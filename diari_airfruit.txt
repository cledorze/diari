1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(Christophe)  1, 2, 1, 2.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
(Christophe)  Hi Sam, how are you doing?

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
(Ysam)  I'm good, I'm good.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
(Ysam)  Did you like Mark's
suggestions?

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
(Christophe)  It's great, I have to make
them digest. I made a few bots, I'm
waiting for it to be stable and reliable
and I'll show you what's next.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
(Ysam)  As you can see, what you
like about most brands is that they keep
things as short and simple as possible.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
(Ysam)  In the end, that's the
hardest thing to do, to have the word
that makes reference to everything and
nothing.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
(Ysam)  It's amazing. In the end,
we think it's simple, but it's not.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
(Christophe)  I like your approach and
it's easy to find what you need.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
(Christophe)  If it's fruit, I like what
Kim suggested. I thought it was nice,
but whatever.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
(Ysam)  The most important thing
is to make a choice and stick to it.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:06,000
(Ysam)  When people meet for the
first time, they'll ask me directly,
what's your brand?

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
(Ysam)  It will stay in their
head. It's a bit like us in IT, you give
them the first idea, and in the
meantime, you change the client.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
(Christophe)  Fiorella is here, I'm just
waiting for Kim to show up.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
(Ysam)  We're not limited to that,
but let's talk about what I suggested at
the beginning for Glekscore.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
(Ysam)  The name of the holding,
which has a precise meaning, global,
exchange.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
(Ysam)  The meanings we take from
the Internet each time, if we take the
name of the holding, if we take this one
or the other.

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
(Ysam)  Find something that makes
reference to what we do, that is
available.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
(Ysam)  When I check Glekscore,
it's available everywhere, .com, .fr,
whatever you want.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
(Ysam)  It's not a brand that
already exists or a word that comes from
something.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:13,000
(Ysam)  They did it at the
beginning, they knew they didn't have
.com or .fr.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
(Ysam)  They added an A at the
end, two years later.

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
(Ysam)  It turned into 3A with a
.nl.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
(Ysam)  But at the same time, they
realized that at one point, the
ricasse.com had emerged.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
(Ysam)  It was active, it also
made food.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
(Ysam)  In the end, the client is
simple-minded.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
(Ysam)  He types ricasse.com and
that's it.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
(Ysam)  For us, it's obvious, the
.com, .fr or search.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
(Ysam)  People are limited to the
page.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
(Ysam)  So, that's it.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
(Ysam)  So, overall, we're here.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
(Christophe)  What is Hakim doing?

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
(Ysam)  Yeah, what is he doing?

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
(Ysam)  Either we let her in and
we discuss.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
(Christophe)  Yeah, maybe, because she's
going to ask for another name.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
(Ysam)  She sent me a message, she
said, I'm waiting.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
(Christophe)  Okay, I'll let her in
later.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
(Ysam)  Yeah, let her in.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's go.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
(Ysam)  Hello, Fiola.

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
(Fiorella)  Hi.

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
(Ysam)  Hi, Fiola, how are you
doing?

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
(Fiorella)  I'm fine, thank you.

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
(Ysam)  Thanks, how are you doing?

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
(Ysam)  I'm fine, thanks.

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
(Fiorella)  Nice to hear it.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
(Fiorella)  I've not heard from you.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
(Ysam)  Yeah, nice to hear you
again, yeah.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
(Ysam)  Long time we didn't speak
actually on the phone.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
(Ysam)  So, I think let's start by
presentation.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
(Ysam)  I think we have Christophe
with us now.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
(Ysam)  Hakim will join also.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
(Ysam)  I think, Fiola, you know
me.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
(Ysam)  So, I am Issam and I will
let Christophe introduce himself.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
(Christophe)  Sure.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
(Christophe)  Hi, Fiola.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
(Christophe)  So, I'm Christophe Ledoux.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
(Christophe)  I'm based in France and I
work in the IT for like, how old am I
now?

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
(Christophe)  43, so let's say 20 years.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
(Christophe)  And I've been from the
military aspect and then I was security
officer

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
(Christophe)  and now I have a focus on
every, let's say, new technology and
everything around data,

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
(Christophe)  you know, this AI stuff,
emerging things.

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
(Christophe)  We can leverage
information that there is on the field
to something more interesting

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
(Christophe)  from a centralization
point of view.

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
(Christophe)  So, I'm basically the
technical consciousness here, I think.

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
(Ysam)  Thanks, Christophe.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
(Fiorella)  Nice, Christophe.

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
(Fiorella)  Christophe is the correct
pronunciation?

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
(Ysam)  Exactly, perfect.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
(Ysam)  Exactly.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
(Ysam)  Christophe.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
(Fiorella)  I'm trying to connect with
my computer.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
(Ysam)  Okay.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
(Ysam)  Okay.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
(Ysam)  And I think it will be the
same.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
(Ysam)  I think we are waiting
also for Hakim.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
(Ysam)  He will join in a few
minutes.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
(Ysam)  So, take your time.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
(Ysam)  Take a few minutes and
then like that we can then start.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
(Fiorella)  I'm on the phone.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
(Christophe)  Thank you.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
(Christophe)  Okay.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
(Christophe)  Hakim is joining.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
(Christophe)  Here he is.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
(Akim)  Hello.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
(Akim)  Hello, everyone.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
(Akim)  Hello, Hakim.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
(Akim)  Hello, guys.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
(Akim)  Sorry for being late.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
(Akim)  I had some calls just
before.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
(Akim)  How are you doing, guys?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
(Akim)  Good, good.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
(Akim)  Good, good.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
(Akim)  Thank you.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
(Akim)  Joanna, nice to meet you.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
(Fiorella)  Pretty good.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
(Fiorella)  How are you?

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
(Fiorella)  Nice to see you.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
(Akim)  How are you doing in Peru?

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
(Fiorella)  Here, I'm fine.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
(Fiorella)  Here is winter, but the
weather is crazy sometimes because it's
shiny and then cold.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
(Fiorella)  Really?

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
(Fiorella)  It's crazy.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
(Akim)  Okay.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
(Akim)  Yeah.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
(Akim)  Okay.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
(Fiorella)  Because now we have the
presence of phenomenon El Niño.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
(Fiorella)  Are you listening about
that?

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
(Akim)  Wow.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
(Akim)  Okay.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
(Akim)  So, El Niño is around.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
(Ysam)  Yeah.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
(Ysam)  Maybe if you want to take
one or two minutes to connect computer,
it's fine for you.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
(Ysam)  Take your time if you want
to connect with computer.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
(Fiorella)  I'm waiting for your
accept.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
(Fiorella)  Could you accept me?

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
(Fiorella)  Yes.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
(Ysam)  Oh, okay.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
(Ysam)  Hold on.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
(Christophe)  It's done.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
(Christophe)  You should be accepted.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
(Christophe)  Thank you.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
(Christophe)  You are accepted.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
(Ysam)  Yeah.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
(Ysam)  So, just Akeem, we already
try.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
(Ysam)  I think we were starting
to make presentation.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
(Ysam)  Maybe you can do, Akeem,
do the same and then Fiorilas, you can
present yourself.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
(Akim)  No worries.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
(Akim)  So, basically, I'm Akeem.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
(Akim)  I'm based in Paris, in
France.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
(Akim)  I've been working with
Issam and Christophe for a while now.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
(Akim)  And together, as Issam
told you, we are going to build an
import-export company of fruits,

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
(Akim)  exotic fruits.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
(Akim)  And that's why we have
this call today.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
(Akim)  So, the IAD is ready to
target Peru and to start leveraging your
knowledge and expertise

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
(Akim)  over there, Fiorilas, to
start checking what kind of products
will be selling outside of

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
(Akim)  Peru, direction to, let's
say, to Europe, mainly, and take it from
there.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
(Akim)  So, the IAD is ready to
understand what's your activity
nowadays, how do you work, how

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
(Akim)  can we work together, and
how can we progress into a collaboration
mode where you can basically

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
(Akim)  source all the Peruvian
products that you have in your portfolio
or catalog, and then

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
(Akim)  we export that to Europe,
basically, through the company we have
in Netherlands.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
(Akim)  So, that's the overall
IAD.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
(Fiorella)  What kind of products do
you export or import from the world?

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
(Fiorella)  Exotic fruits?

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
(Fiorella)  Like what?

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
(Akim)  Yeah.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
(Akim)  For the moment, we're
focusing only on exotic fruits, only.

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
(Fiorella)  Like what?

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
(Akim)  Like mangoes, like
avocados, like citrus, blueberries, and
stuff like this, yeah.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
(Akim)  But coming from Latin
America only.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
(Akim)  We have contacts in other
countries.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
(Akim)  We are also checking these
days what we can have from other
countries, but we would like

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
(Akim)  to have, to establish a
catalog of products for Peru only.

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
(Akim)  You see?

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
(Akim)  So, basically, it's
having, like I put on the chat, it's
basically having a list of

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
(Akim)  products that we want to
export from Peru, and then we have
already the customers.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
(Akim)  The IAD is then to match
what are the Peruvian products against
the European demand and customers.

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
(Ysam)  Especially for the demand,
what we got from Europe is for the
quality.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
(Ysam)  The difference has been
the quality of the Peruvian product.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
(Ysam)  That's why we all want to
focus.

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
(Ysam)  I mean, now, a final
customer asking for the prime quality
of, if we take example of the

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
(Ysam)  mango, we got a supplier
for mango from many countries, but at
the end, the customer is

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
(Ysam)  asking, especially for the
taste, is asking for the quality and the
taste of the Peruvian

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
(Ysam)  mango.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
(Ysam)  That's why, now, we are
building for different regions, but for
Peru, we want to be focused

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
(Ysam)  and to build a catalog of
only a select product, like mango, or we
talked before, ginger.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
(Ysam)  So, yes, we can also
develop that.

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
(Ysam)  But, yes, the focus for
Peru is to, yes, to be focused and to
get the best value of what

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
(Ysam)  we can get.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,000
(Fiorella)  So, mainly, we need to
work in mango, avocados.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
(Fiorella)  I can find some grapes,
but it depends of the volume.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
(Fiorella)  It depends of the variety.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:25,000
(Fiorella)  You know, we specialize
here in seedless, red and white, but
most of them, of this company,

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
(Fiorella)  export mainly to the big
companies in Europe, United States, and
Asia.

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
(Fiorella)  And some of them have some
office in China also and in Europe.

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
(Akim)  In China?

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
(Akim)  Okay.

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
(Akim)  Sorry, Fiora.

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
(Akim)  Just a quick question.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
(Akim)  When you say, let's say,
mangoes, for instance, what variety do
you have?

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
(Akim)  Do you have Kent?

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
(Akim)  Do you have other variety
of mangoes?

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
(Akim)  And what is the caliber?

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
(Fiorella)  Kent and Edward.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
(Fiorella)  Both.

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
(Akim)  Kent?

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
(Akim)  And, sorry, what is the
other one?

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
(Fiorella)  Edward.

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
(Fiorella)  Edward.

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
(Ysam)  The Edward is the yellow
one, Fiora, no?

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
(Ysam)  The Edward mango.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
(Ysam)  It's yellow, no?

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
(Ysam)  Yeah.

204
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
(Ysam)  For a yellow mango, it's
much more sweet, but it's yellow, you
know?

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
(Fiorella)  It's big.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
(Ysam)  Sorry, what did you say?

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
(Fiorella)  It's big.

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
(Ysam)  It's the name of the
mango?

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
(Ysam)  Edward.

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
(Ysam)  Edward, okay.

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
(Ysam)  Edward, okay.

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
(Akim)  And what is the caliber
that you can have in those varieties?

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
(Akim)  What is the caliber that
you can have?

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:52,000
(Fiorella)  Now, the last season, I
can't ship mango because we try to
export mango

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
(Fiorella)  from Peru to Asia,
basically because of the prices and, you
know, the cost

216
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
(Fiorella)  or the final price by air.

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
(Fiorella)  And at the beginning of
the season, it's the best.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,000
(Fiorella)  But then we can't do
anything because most of the companies
here in Peru

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:29,000
(Fiorella)  export mango, but not in
the good condition because, I mean, they
cut the

220
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
(Fiorella)  fruit before they get the
best, how is it?

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
(Ysam)  They make the harvest
early, you mean.

222
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
(Fiorella)  What, what?

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
(Ysam)  They make the harvest.

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
(Ysam)  They pick the mango before
it becomes mature.

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah, but the technical
word for the sugar, I forgot now.

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
(Fiorella)  The sweet, I think.

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
(Ysam)  I don't know.

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:08,000
(Fiorella)  The sweet, but they have a
technical word for when they throw
together

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
(Fiorella)  the correct sweetness.

230
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
(Fiorella)  So they, we cannot export
to Asia and then move forward only to
Europe,

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:37,000
(Fiorella)  but basically, I can't
find another supplier for mango because
the main goal

232
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,000
(Fiorella)  here in this business is
to contact to the producer and exporter.

233
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
(Fiorella)  Or mainly when a company
want to establish here in Peru to talk
about the,

234
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
(Fiorella)  like a country procurement
manager.

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
(Fiorella)  Oh, Bricks, yes.

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
(Fiorella)  Thank you.

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
(Ysam)  Bricks.

238
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
(Ysam)  Bricks, yeah.

239
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
(Ysam)  The Bricks, yeah.

240
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

241
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
(Fiorella)  I forgot that.

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
(Akim)  That's okay.

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
(Christophe)  It's not me, that's AI.

244
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,000
(Fiorella)  So, and also the other
part that is very important is the
packing house.

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
(Akim)  Yeah.

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
(Akim)  Okay.

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
(Akim)  So all the packaging, you
mean, around the product.

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
(Akim)  Is that what you mean?

251
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
(Akim)  Or the warehouse?

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
(Akim)  When you mean packing
house, is it the packaging process or is
it the

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
(Akim)  warehouse process?

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
(Fiorella)  The packaging process.

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
(Ysam)  And just a question,
Fiorila.

257
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
(Ysam)  Do you think, example,
what do you think the best way to work
is to by

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
(Ysam)  yourself to talk directly
to the producer and then manage the
warehouse

259
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
(Ysam)  and packaging?

260
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
(Ysam)  Example for you, you can
do that in Peru.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
(Ysam)  Or do you think it's
better to talk directly to someone in
the warehouse?

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
(Ysam)  What is, I mean, the goal
is to have, let's say, a good quantity
or good

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
(Ysam)  volume of mango by hair.

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
(Ysam)  So to make that strong,
what do you think is the best option?

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
(Ysam)  I mean, is to find a
producer to securize and then to talk to
warehouse

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
(Ysam)  separately or directly if
you have someone directly now you think
is

267
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
(Ysam)  strong and you can trust
him to provide the right quantity and
the right

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
(Ysam)  quality of the mango by
hair.

269
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
(Fiorella)  It depends the volume and
the forecast that you are planning to
import.

270
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
(Fiorella)  If you have, if you need a
big volume, we can work with two ways
and

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
(Fiorella)  negotiate directly with
the producers and other way is to
contact directly

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
(Fiorella)  from the exporter or the
packing house and try to get the more
volume.

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
(Fiorella)  And also it's very
important to check in the line, in the
packing house,

274
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:08,000
(Fiorella)  have a QC because we need
to pay before the process or no, before
no,

275
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
(Fiorella)  after the process.

276
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
(Fiorella)  When the fruit is ready to
go, to load.

277
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
(Ysam)  Yeah.

279
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
(Ysam)  Okay.

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
(Ysam)  Okay.

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
(Ysam)  Okay.

282
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
(Akim)  Good.

283
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
(Akim)  And what is for you, okay,
if we say, for instance, we start with

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
(Akim)  mangoes.

285
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
(Akim)  So let's say we start with
mangoes, variety Kent.

286
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
(Akim)  What is the caliber that
you can have on Kent?

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
(Akim)  Is it kind of nine, 10,
eight?

288
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
(Akim)  What is the caliber that
you can have on that one, on the Kent
one?

289
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
(Fiorella)  In Kent, let me check the
last, the last technical sheet that they
provide

290
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
(Fiorella)  to me.

291
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
(Akim)  Let me check.

292
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, no worries.

293
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
(Akim)  And the other thing is the
season for the Kent in Peru.

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
(Akim)  Is it kind of seven
months, eight months, or what is the
season for that?

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
(Fiorella)  Mango here is starting on
the last of September, the end of
September

296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
(Fiorella)  or October until to
February.

297
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
(Ysam)  Okay.

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
(Ysam)  Oh, yes.

299
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
(Ysam)  Also, I think one good
question to raise also to be when it can
be available

300
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
(Ysam)  because we know what if I
mean, what is the real season, but
sometimes we

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
(Ysam)  know what some producer
can got some pallets.

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
(Ysam)  Let's say many, many
pallets available before, just before
the season

303
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
(Ysam)  and also after end of the
season.

304
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
(Ysam)  You know what I mean?

305
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
(Ysam)  Some producer are playing
and got some stocks.

306
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:04,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah, we can find before
or after these four months, but you
know,

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
(Fiorella)  the quality is not the
best.

308
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

309
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
(Fiorella)  Focus in these months
only.

310
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
(Fiorella)  Right.

311
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

312
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
(Akim)  Okay, all right.

313
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
(Akim)  Okay.

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
(Akim)  In this month only, this
is where we can get the quality of the
best

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
(Akim)  mangoes.

316
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
(Akim)  Okay, makes sense.

317
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
(Fiorella)  And also the prices, and
also we can negotiate the prices with
different

318
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
(Fiorella)  producers.

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
(Fiorella)  They have, you know.

321
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
(Akim)  But like you said, it's
best to negotiate the prices at the
beginning

322
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
(Akim)  of the season, right?

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
(Fiorella)  At the beginning of the
season, yeah.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
(Akim)  Yeah.

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
(Fiorella)  And it depends of the
market, you know.

326
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
(Fiorella)  If the market is very
strong and the demand is very high, the
prices,

327
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
(Fiorella)  it's high.

328
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
(Fiorella)  But it depends of the
producers that we can work together and
also the

329
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
(Fiorella)  relationship and network
is very important in this business.

330
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for
sure.

331
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
(Akim)  For sure.

332
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
(Akim)  And you have already
connections with mango producers, I
mean.

333
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
(Akim)  Yeah.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
(Akim)  Okay.

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
(Akim)  And, okay, good.

336
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
(Fiorella)  And some export companies
also.

337
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
(Akim)  And some export companies
also.

338
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
(Akim)  Okay, makes sense.

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
(Akim)  And then, let's say, we
start with mangoes.

340
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
(Akim)  But then, you know, the
season, it's, let's say, October to
February.

341
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
(Akim)  But what do we do for the
rest of the year?

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
(Akim)  What are the usual, you
know, fruits or vegetables that you do
for the rest

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
(Akim)  of the year?

344
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
(Akim)  Is there any other fruit
or vegetables that you do for, you know,
to be

345
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
(Akim)  kind of completing the
rest of the year?

346
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
(Akim)  Do you do like avocado
with variety ass or do you do stuff like
this?

347
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah, here, it's a certain
season for ginger.

348
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

349
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
(Fiorella)  Ginger season is from June
to February.

350
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
(Fiorella)  And also avocados.

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
(Fiorella)  Because, you know, here in
Peru, we have two seasons for avocados.

352
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
(Fiorella)  Early season is starting
in February until March, February,
March, April.

353
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
(Fiorella)  April, end of May.

354
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
(Fiorella)  And you learn the big
volume.

355
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
(Fiorella)  It's from July, August to
the rest of the month.

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:40,000
(Fiorella)  So, also, in the middle of
this, we can find grapes.

357
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
(Fiorella)  It depends.

358
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
(Fiorella)  September, October, it's
starting the season for grapes.

359
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
(Akim)  Okay.

360
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
(Akim)  Let's say, for instance,
we want to prepare some set of products
for

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
(Akim)  September.

362
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
(Akim)  Let's say September, yeah,
September.

363
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
(Akim)  What will be the products
that we can prepare?

364
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
(Akim)  Is it like mangoes,
grapes?

365
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
(Akim)  What are the products?

366
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
(Akim)  Avocados.

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
(Akim)  Avocados?

368
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
(Akim)  Okay.

369
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
(Fiorella)  Asparagus, you sure?

370
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah, I can find
asparagus, yeah.

371
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
(Fiorella)  Fresh, yes?

372
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
(Ysam)  Yeah, always fresh.

373
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
(Ysam)  For sure.

374
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
(Ysam)  Almost, yeah.

375
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
(Akim)  For sure.

376
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
(Akim)  When we say, when we say,
we forgot to say that, but when we say

377
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
(Akim)  products, we want always
to have these products, you know, sent
by

378
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
(Akim)  plane, basically.

379
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
(Akim)  We want to have fresh
products in order for us to, in order
for us to

380
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
(Akim)  have good quality
products.

381
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
(Akim)  Okay.

382
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
(Akim)  So, let's say mangoes,
grapes, avocados, and then you say right
now

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
(Akim)  that's the ginger season.

384
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
(Akim)  And what else do you have
right now for the season in Peru?

385
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
(Akim)  Do you have like, what
else do you have right now for this
season in

386
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
(Akim)  Peru?

387
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
(Akim)  Do you have, let's say,
coffee, chocolate, or stuff like this?

388
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
(Fiorella)  Coffee, chocolate, both of
them.

389
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:20,000
(Fiorella)  In chocolate, we have
beans, cocoa beans, nibs, the other one
is

390
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,000
(Fiorella)  butter, and also
chocolate.

391
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
(Fiorella)  Coffee, green coffee, and
roasted coffee.

392
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
(Fiorella)  You know, Peru is now
known as the best producer and exporter
from

393
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:48,000
(Fiorella)  cacao, because it's fine,
they specialize in one kind of cocoa,
and

394
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
(Fiorella)  also the other is coffee,
specialized coffee for the highland, and
the

395
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
(Fiorella) re they have the anchovies,
the origins of the harvests, they have
the

396
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
(Fiorella)  excellence of the caps,
and they have a good creation about
that, you

397
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
(Fiorella)  know.

398
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

399
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
(Ysam)  Do you understand the goal
after this?

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
(Ysam)  Yes.

401
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
(Ysam)  We wanted to build a
strong catalog with all the best
products from

402
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,800
(Ysam)  You know, that's why we
are asking you for different kinds of
products.

403
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:37,440
(Fiorella)  I can prepare. I have a
separate catalog for fresh and dry
products.

404
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,960
(Fiorella)  I can match together or we
can manage separate also.

405
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,000
(Akim)  Okay. The idea basically,
like Issam said, is that we want to
understand what you have as a

406
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,440
(Akim)  portfolio or products.
Like that, we'll be building a website
coming soon where we'll

407
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,760
(Akim)  put all the products. We
will communicate around that. We have
already a few customers,

408
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,360
(Akim)  but we are growing. So
we'll get probably good customers and
bigger customers also.

409
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,880
(Akim)  So this is the overall
idea. And what we want also is to have
you as a working with us, let's say,

410
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,920
(Akim)  as a representative of our
company in Peru. Okay. Like that, you
will be the one sourcing

411
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,640
(Akim)  all the producers in Peru,
sourcing all the packaging, the
warehouse and so on in Peru.

412
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,120
(Akim)  And then we export that
directly to Europe. Our main target is
really Europe. And in Europe,

413
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,400
(Akim)  we will sell to different
companies. We are based in France, but
we can basically cover all Europe.

414
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,840
(Akim)  We can cover also Middle
East. We can cover Eastern Europe. We
can cover Russia from where

415
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,760
(Fiorella)  we are. Okay. And I think
then for... Export directly. I try to
understand. Export

416
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:52,720
(Fiorella)  directly to Europe,
Rotterdam maybe, and then move. This is
the hub to move forward to the...

417
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,800
(Akim)  Exactly. That's the idea.
We have a company in Rotterdam. So it's
not an issue. The idea is to

418
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:06,320
(Akim)  get that into Rotterdam
and then spread that across Europe.
Okay. And we can do also... But

419
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,320
(Akim)  that's one way of doing
it. We can also do it the other way,
meaning we can also take

420
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,360
(Akim)  Peruvian products and sell
that to the U.S. We have connections in
the U.S. and we can do that

421
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,040
(Akim)  also in Asia. But it
depends in Asia. It's a big country
where it's the most interesting.

422
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,760
(Akim)  But basically, I don't
know if you work already with the U.S.,
but we have contacts over there

423
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,280
(Akim)  and they could be also
interested by Peruvian products,
whatever it is.

424
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,000
(Akim)  Is that the market that
you cover already, the U.S.? Yeah, I
know the market.

425
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,920
(Fiorella)  And I have some customers
around the world, so... Okay. And what
do you sell mostly in the U.S.?

426
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:52,320
(Akim)  Do you sell mangoes over
there as well, or what do you sell the
most? No. Grapes.

427
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,960
(Akim)  Grapes, yeah. The red one
or the white ones? The red verb? White.
Seedless.

428
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:09,680
(Fiorella)  Seedless, okay. From
United States, it's avocados, some
avocados, more often grapes,

429
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:21,120
(Fiorella)  some ginger, and also to
Canada, ginger and grapes. And also, I
have customers that they sell to

430
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:32,720
(Fiorella)  Emirates. They're asking
for a freight from Jordan. Jordan, okay.

431
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:46,800
(Fiorella)  Another one. The other one
is... The transit is very, very long
because they want to ship to Aqaba.

432
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,240
(Fiorella)  Sorry, say that again?
Aqaba? Aqaba, Aqaba port, yeah.

433
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,440
(Akim)  In which country? Sorry, I
know the country, but the port
sometimes?

434
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,480
(Ysam)  Aqaba is the port of
Aqaba. It's the port of Jordania.
Jordania, okay.

435
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,800
(Ysam)  Yes, of course, it's
complex if they want to ship directly to
Aqaba.

436
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:19,760
(Fiorella)  Well, Dubai, Jebel Ali,
and Aqaba, Beirut, and Shuwaik. So, if
you have customers in these

437
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,360
(Fiorella)  countries, we can do
something with ginger because they buy a
lot of ginger from us.

438
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:37,440
(Fiorella)  I know that our prices,
it's very different than China and then
Brazil, but our quality in those

439
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:46,400
(Fiorella)  products are very
different. Same for mango. Mango from
Asia, it's very cheap. Here in Peru,

440
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,440
(Fiorella)  it's different, but mainly
the difference is in the quality and the
flavor and the taste.

441
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,360
(Akim)  It depends. Mangoes, for
instance, it depends in Asia where you
source them. If you take mangoes

442
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,440
(Akim)  from Filipinas, they're
quite good. It depends which country you
are talking about. If you take

443
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,080
(Akim)  mangoes from, let's say,
Vietnam or others, it's a different
quality. It depends.

444
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,920
(Fiorella)  But the flavor is very
large. So, here it is short.

445
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,240
(Akim)  I see what you mean. Okay,
got it.

446
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,320
(Ysam)  And I have a question,
Fiora, about two products. What about
banana and pineapple?

447
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,800
(Ysam)  I mean, there is not
something-

448
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,320
(Fiorella)  Pineapple, it's very,
very, very short. The production is
little.

449
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,200
(Ysam)  Ah, it's little. But
example, what do you mean by little?
Example, can we-

450
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,920
(Fiorella)  I don't know because I
don't know this business of pineapple. I
know that we have some

451
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:50,320
(Fiorella)  hectares from pineapple.
The variety is golden and Hawaiian. We
have two. Golden is the

452
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,160
(Fiorella)  best for- It's very nice
taste, yeah.

453
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,480
(Fiorella)  Eat directly and the taste
is very sweet.

454
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,200
(Fiorella)  Yeah. And banana, we have
a lot of banana.

455
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,440
(Fiorella)  Organic. Organic or so?

456
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,120
(Fiorella)  Okay. For export, yeah.
And I have the contact

457
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:18,160
(Fiorella)  for banana. If you want,
we can contact some producers in Piura,
near to, for the farms of

458
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,120
(Fiorella)  mango. Yeah.

459
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,000
(Akim)  Okay. Issam told us a lot
about Piura.

460
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,760
(Ysam)  It's nice area.

461
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,360
(Fiorella)  He lives there.

462
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,920
(Akim)  Okay. Sounds good. So,
basically, you have understood the idea
is to build the catalog

463
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,480
(Akim)  and then we are going to
spread it across Europe. We have
customers already in Germany,

464
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,040
(Akim)  in Switzerland, in France.
We are here and then we can cover easily
Middle East

465
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:54,240
(Akim)  and Eastern Europe and so
on. What else? Yeah. And the idea is for
you to be part of our

466
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:05,680
(Akim)  business and source every
product over there that we need. And
you'll be doing also, on our behalf,

467
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,400
(Akim)  you know this big expo in
September called Expo Alimentaria? You
know that in Peru,

468
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,400
(Akim)  there is this big
exhibition called Expo Alimentaria.
You've been there?

469
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,120
(Akim)  Yeah. Yeah. So, the idea
is for us

470
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,280
(Akim)  to give you all the tools
for you to go there and to prospect the
companies we want to target.

471
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,040
(Akim)  You see, because we have
different companies over there and so
on. So, the idea is for us

472
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,680
(Akim)  to give you the tools for
you to be representative over there.

473
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,120
(Akim)  What else? Issam,
Christophe, you want to say something?

474
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,120
(Christophe)  As a technical
consciousness, maybe I'd like to see how
I can help you with the tooling,

475
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:55,360
(Christophe)  especially. Basically, we
have a way to work with Hakim and Issam.
Maybe you have a different way

476
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,120
(Christophe)  and I'd like to see how I
can help you, basically, on your day-to-
day mission.

477
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,240
(Akim)  So, basically, what he
means is that at the moment we start
working together,

478
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,720
(Akim)  you have a different
address email, we create an account for
you, we'll send you also a phone

479
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,720
(Akim)  out of the company and
like that you have everything on it and
like that you can start

480
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,360
(Akim)  working with us directly.
You see, to keep it simple for us to do
all the transactions and so

481
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,440
(Akim)  on, we have to do it live
through WhatsApp and so on to keep it
real. Christophe needs to take

482
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,840
(Akim)  some time with you,
probably half an hour on a one-to-one
basis. He will discuss with you

483
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,240
(Akim)  the details of the tooling
that he's going to put in place for the
company

484
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,440
(Akim)  and like that you can be
part of that and he'll give you all the
details.

485
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,640
(Akim)  To let you know, in a
nutshell, we are working on the brand.
The brand is going out in a couple

486
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,200
(Akim)  of days. It's a good
brand. You will be using the kind of
Latin one and like that you can use that

487
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,800
(Akim)  and then we will prepare
also the catalog of the brand. We will
prepare also everything based on

488
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,360
(Akim)  the catalog and the
products that you will have in your own
catalog and then like that we can

489
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,080
(Akim)  spread and communicate
around the brand across Europe, across
already our set of customers and

490
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:28,720
(Fiorella)  the new customers that we
are targeting. Also, here in Peru, we
are producing

491
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,600
(Fiorella)  native grains, Asian
grains, so I have a catalog. I don't
know if we specialize

492
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:45,040
(Fiorella)  only in fresh fruit and
coffee and cocoa or we can manage
another kind of products for dry.

493
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:57,760
(Fiorella)  I don't know if
Christopher or Issam, I can share a
catalog now about quinoa and other
grains.

494
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,360
(Akim)  I know Christophe, you are
lucky because Christophe is a big fan of
quinoa.

495
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:14,480
(Christophe)  Yes, we were talking about
the rise of the bubble tea around the
world and so on based on quinoa.

496
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,840
(Fiorella)  You don't have anything to
share.

497
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,840
(Akim)  She can share, Christophe.

498
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
(Akim)  I don't have anything to
share.

499
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,280
(Akim)  Oh, you don't have.

500
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,440
(Akim)  He will give you the right
to share, no worries.

501
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,400
(Fiorella)  Or I can share with Issam
and Issam maybe.

502
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,280
(Akim)  No, you can share
directly, no worries. He will figure it
out.

503
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,440
(Akim)  If you say share screen,
it's not working?

504
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,360
(Christophe)  Hold on, hold on.

505
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,000
(Akim)  How is disabled
participants screen sharing?

506
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,000
(Akim)  Yeah, you're right. You're
right, Fiora, you're right.

507
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,040
(Akim)  By the way, do you come
to... Sorry, Fiora.

508
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,140
(Akim)  What?

509
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,600
(Akim)  No, no, go ahead, go
ahead, please.

510
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:10,240
(Fiorella)  I strongly suggest that
the Expo Alimentaria trade show is not a
show specialized in fresh

511
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:19,680
(Fiorella)  fruit. This show is
specialized in dried products like Asian
grains, cocoa, coffee.

512
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,160
(Ysam)  Rice and everything, yeah.

513
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,080
(Fiorella)  Yeah, rice and the other
products.

514
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,480
(Fiorella)  There are some companies
that they can export fresh fruit, but
this is not a show for fresh

515
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,480
(Fiorella)  fruit. So in this case, I
suggest to have meetings, prepare an
agenda and have meetings with

516
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,320
(Fiorella)  the companies, medium or
small companies that we are looking for
fresh fruit.

517
00:35:50,320 --> 00:36:02,400
(Fiorella)  Mango, grapes, avocados
and try to establish a relationship or
try to get a small program

518
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:11,680
(Fiorella)  at the beginning because
they don't know us and check in which
packing house we can work

519
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,400
(Fiorella)  together. Because I know
that for Europe and the rest of the
countries that they want to

520
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,480
(Fiorella)  fresh from Peru, it's very
important the certificates. Global Gap
and GRASP or SMETA,

521
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,920
(Fiorella)  it's very important and
there are some packing that they don't
have. So it's very important for

522
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:38,560
(Fiorella)  us to get these
certificates. And I know the list of the
packing that we are focused to the best

523
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,940
(Fiorella)  for us.

524
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,440
(Akim)  Okay, makes sense. Okay.
Yeah, that's totally valuable what
you're saying here.

525
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:59,040
(Fiorella)  And also, it's very
important for me to have clear the
situation how we can work together.

526
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:09,520
(Fiorella)  Also, the other good
opportunity that we can apply is that
here in Peru, if you

527
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:19,360
(Fiorella)  open a company and export
directly, but considering to some raw
material from import,

528
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:29,520
(Fiorella)  you have a special fee or
special treatment because you have 3% of
the export, the total of

529
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:48,240
(Fiorella)  the invoice, like a
return. This treatment is called
drawback. This is the name. Are you

530
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,320
(Fiorella)  listening about that?
Drawback?

531
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,920
(Ysam)  Oh, no. Drawback?

532
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,120
(Akim)  It's a retro commission, I
think.

533
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,800
(Akim)  It's a retro commission
program.

534
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:09,680
(Fiorella)  It's a duty for the export
companies from Peru that using a raw
material into the final product.

535
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,880
(Akim)  I have then one question.
If we open a company in Peru, how long
does it take to open one?

536
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,240
(Fiorella)  Only one month or less.

537
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:30,880
(Akim)  One month or less? But if
we say you open the company on our
behalf, is it something you can do?

538
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,680
(Fiorella)  No, I want to understand
how we can work together.

539
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
(Fiorella)  Yeah, okay. Okay, got it.

540
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,280
(Fiorella)  Basically, drawback is the
– how I explain? A refund of duties.

541
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
(Fiorella)  Yeah, okay.

542
00:38:48,640 --> 00:39:00,720
(Fiorella)  Yeah, because the main or
the most important in this duty is that
you as an export company

543
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:14,480
(Fiorella)  consider a raw material
into the final product for import. So,
drawbacks, refunds only

544
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:28,560
(Fiorella)  allow upon the export of
the imported merchandise for a valid
substitute for article that is

545
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:41,360
(Fiorella)  manufactured from the
export. And this duty of drawback is 3%
of the total amount of the invoice,

546
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,880
(Fiorella)  export invoice. Do you
understand?

547
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,720
(Akim)  Yeah, we have noted that.
Okay.

548
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,560
(Ysam)  Can you give us just an
overview also? I think it's something
important for the future.

549
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,160
(Ysam)  What is about the reality
of how we're going to pay the producer
and everything? Because as you

550
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,040
(Ysam)  saw, I was checking also
with that with Analucia before. I saw
how she was doing in the reality.

551
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,400
(Ysam)  And what is the payment? I
mean, because I was checking that some
producer was asking payment

552
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:22,240
(Ysam)  in cash, half-half, you
know. I mean, what will be our reality
if we work with Peruvian products?

553
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,800
(Fiorella)  From producers? From
farmers?

554
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,600
(Ysam)  Yeah, I mean, example,
yeah. Tomorrow, let's say we took
example, we start, okay. I want,

555
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,800
(Ysam)  I need 50 pallets of
mango. What will be the reality of the
transaction?

556
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,320
(Ysam)  We have to send money to
the bank account in Peru. Then we have
to take out cash to

557
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:48,720
(Ysam)  give products. I mean, we
have to know what will be the reality. I
mean, what's going to happen?

558
00:40:50,160 --> 00:41:00,720
(Fiorella)  Most of this kind of
transaction is by transfer. If you open
a company here in Peru,

559
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:10,800
(Fiorella)  as an exporter company,
one of the requirements is that you have
a bank account from the company

560
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:21,440
(Fiorella)  and do all the operations
from the bank by internet or by
transfer.

561
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,800
(Ysam)  Yeah.

562
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:31,840
(Fiorella)  If the producer, they
don't have an account on bank, it's in
cash, but there are a few.

563
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,600
(Ysam)  I mean, what I'm telling
you is that we are looking only for
producer who found. We don't

564
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,400
(Ysam)  want to work with cash.
That's what we don't want. We don't want
to be in a situation.

565
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,080
(Fiorella)  Maybe sometimes, yes, but
it's not the usual because most of them,
they have an account,

566
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:56,640
(Fiorella)  but if they don't have, it
can be in cash through a document signed
for both parties.

567
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,880
(Ysam)  Anyway, in the future, we
want to make something secure, you know,
not something

568
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,160
(Ysam)  in the long term. We want
to find in the best way some producer,
even if in some time,

569
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,800
(Ysam)  for any reason, we have to
do it by cash. If we have someone there,
you can transact, of course,

570
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,840
(Ysam)  but I mean, in the usual,
what we want to build this relationship
with the producer,

571
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:30,560
(Ysam)  something's wrong. I mean,
something's clear, you know, not every
week we have to come back on this

572
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,920
(Ysam)  is because this week, this
producer is asking us by cash and next
week, it's fine. I mean,

573
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,240
(Ysam)  I wasn't thinking because
I saw the reality, what was doing at
Narusea and it was like that,

574
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:50,480
(Ysam)  and I told her, no, I
think I'm talking with Evan, for all of
us here with Akim and Christophe,

575
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,480
(Ysam)  we don't want that, you
know, that's something found. Maybe from
my voice, we don't want this

576
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,280
(Ysam)  kind of business, you
know, especially when we are not in
there, you know, we are far away in

577
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,960
(Akim)  Europe. That's not
something we are interested in. I think
at the end, Fiorella, we need to keep it

578
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:14,400
(Akim)  as simple as possible,
meaning we are the expert company in
Europe, you know, the producers

579
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,480
(Akim)  in Peru. I'm not sure we
especially need to create a company in
Peru. I think it's better for us to

580
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,200
(Akim)  get directly the products
from the producers and you are in
between, you see, between us and the

581
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,800
(Akim)  producer, there is you,
and we make transactions like this. I
think we can pay, of course, directly

582
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,760
(Akim)  the producers in his
account in Peru, even sending money from
Europe. I think that for the moment,

583
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,920
(Akim)  that's the way we want to
proceed in order for us to be quick,
efficient, and avoid, you know,

584
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,480
(Akim)  going to Peru, creating
company, this and that. I think at this
stage, we really want to keep it

585
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:52,880
(Fiorella)  simple. Okay, but take in
mind that some producers only produce
and they don't export. So, in this

586
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:03,360
(Fiorella)  case, we can work with
medium or small companies that export
directly for us. They can make the

587
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,200
(Ysam)  job. If they make the job,
it's fine, you know. If they make the
job as we request for the start,

588
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:17,360
(Ysam)  it's fine, you know. At
the beginning, yeah. Okay, I mean, from
the beginning, what we need,

589
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,640
(Ysam)  especially, so, I mean,
what will our customer request as some,
you know, technical aspect,

590
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,160
(Ysam)  you know, that's what we
need for beginning. We have to start the
process and building the

591
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:34,160
(Ysam)  business. Even if they are
small export company, that's fine. If
they are easy to work with,

592
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,120
(Akim)  you know, for everything,
it's even better, you know. So,
something also important for Fiola is

593
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:47,520
(Akim)  also to communicate around
the products, the quality, and so on.
So, we are building the

594
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,840
(Akim)  website with Christophe
and so on. We are nearly finalizing it.
But once it's done, what would be

595
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:00,320
(Akim)  good? If you are able to
have or to create, we discussed that
with Christophe, but to create

596
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:07,040
(Akim)  some videos, let's say you
find a producer of mango, you discuss
with this producer of mango,

597
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,520
(Akim)  even in Spanish, we don't
care, and then we can translate that
into English. But the idea is to

598
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:19,440
(Akim)  have videos of the
production. Let's say mangoes, we want
to see the mangoes into a video at some

599
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,520
(Akim)  point, and to see the full
process from really collecting the
mangoes till the process when it's

600
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,040
(Akim)  washed and so on, etc,
etc. And if you can do that kind of
video, that will be helpful like that.

601
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,280
(Akim)  Like that for each
product, we will say to the customers
that we have in Europe,

602
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,360
(Akim)  okay, look, this is fresh
products collected in Peru. It's live,
you know. It's live. It's kind of

603
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:49,040
(Akim)  activity that will put
confidence into the quality of our
products. And it's not a video where we
say,

604
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,880
(Akim)  this is the producer, we
give his name and so on. No, we don't
need to give the name of the

605
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,480
(Akim)  producer. We just want to
see the action, the activity of the
producer collecting the mango,

606
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,240
(Akim)  like organic mango into a
tree and then taking back into our
packaging and so on,

607
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,960
(Akim)  you know, the full
process. And then we will communicate
around that. You see what I mean?

608
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,600
(Akim)  It will be a way for us to
say to our future customers, look, the
quality is here. We've

609
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,720
(Akim)  done that. The producer is
in Peru, but you can see the products by
yourself. They are good

610
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,720
(Akim)  quality products. So, we
have to re-insure them because all those
customers in Europe,

611
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,200
(Akim)  like Issam said, they are
far. They want to see the reality of the
production as well.

612
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,240
(Ysam)  Yes. They don't want to
feel like they are just talking to just
a trader based in Europe.

613
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:36,400
(Ysam)  Yeah.

614
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,880
(Ysam)  They don't even know
what's happening in Peru. It's much
more...

615
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,680
(Akim)  The back end. They need to
have an understanding of the back end,
basically.

616
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,240
(Akim)  So, yeah.

617
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,440
(Fiorella)  It's like telling a story
of half the...

618
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,560
(Fiorella)  Exactly. What's the story
behind it?

619
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,400
(Fiorella)  And then process.

620
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,080
(Akim)  Exactly. Have you done
that before?

621
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:10,640
(Fiorella)  Yeah. Because part of my
experience is to create a website,
design a packaging and labels from the

622
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,480
(Fiorella)  last companies that I
worked.

623
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,600
(Fiorella)  Okay. Cool.

624
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,000
(Fiorella)  So, I have some experience
of that.

625
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,120
(Fiorella)  Okay.

626
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:28,480
(Fiorella)  We like to create and
design brands for fruits and also for
other kinds of products, but I like it.

627
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,080
(Akim)  Okay. Excellent. So,
that's the way we will be building also
the company,

628
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,200
(Akim)  but we need to communicate
and probably we put that on YouTube,

629
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,120
(Akim)  on our own website. We do
that. We do some blogs.

630
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:46,800
(Akim)  Also, we have a lot of
communication package ready to start to
be known and to start also

631
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,440
(Akim)  to target the customers we
want to target and having big programs
with them.

632
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,560
(Akim)  Okay. Good. What else?

633
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,280
(Akim)  Yeah. The other question
is, do you travel?

634
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,640
(Akim)  I mean, do you go, for
instance, to the big exhibition in
Madrid?

635
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,800
(Akim)  Do you go to Berlin?

636
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,920
(Akim)  Do you travel on a regular
basis or not at all?

637
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,960
(Akim)  Or do you only stay in
Peru and Latin America and the US?

638
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:18,880
(Fiorella)  This year, I don't
participate in any shows, but most of
them, I participate in big shows like

639
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:27,840
(Fiorella)  Berlin, Hong Kong, World
Logistics, Fancy Food, Seattle, Anuga,
Gulf Foods.

640
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:33,360
(Fiorella)  I participate in a lot of
shows and travel around the world and
into Peru also.

641
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:44,960
(Fiorella)  But this year, I'm working
by my side. I'm not working for a
special company. I'm giving a

642
00:48:45,760 --> 00:49:06,560
(Fiorella)  house, like teaching the
companies how to export. I am the
outsourcing for commercial area from

643
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,040
(Fiorella)  one company in Pichanaki
that they export ginger.

644
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,640
(Akim)  Ginger. Okay.

645
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,480
(Fiorella)  Yeah. But I know about
that.

646
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,000
(Akim)  So, basically, you are
being an export manager for these
companies, right?

647
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,760
(Akim)  So, you teach them how to
export their own products and foods and
vegetables.

648
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,200
(Fiorella)  Like export and commercial
because I help in the transaction and
operation about the export.

649
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,600
(Fiorella)  I know all the process
about the export. I know how to do the
documents, how to contact

650
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:54,400
(Fiorella)  to customs. I know all the
process about the export of
agribusiness, agriculture, and agri—how

651
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:05,360
(Fiorella)  is it? Agroindustrial
products. So, I know about that. I know
the agent, the shipping lines,

652
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:11,360
(Fiorella)  managers. I have a lot of
networking with this business.

653
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,880
(Ysam)  Yeah. Especially the
transport and customer also. Transport,
cargo, by air.

654
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
(Fiorella)  Transport, customs. Yeah.
Logistics.

655
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,240
(Akim)  Yeah. Okay.

656
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,800
(Akim)  Cool. Important point
also, Issam. I don't know if you
mentioned that to Fiorella,

657
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,520
(Akim)  but I think at some point,
we need also to find a way to pay you
for your services.

658
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,920
(Akim)  So, we need to think about
that. But basically, there is two
options. We need to discuss that

659
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,880
(Akim)  with Issam, but we need to
also to understand which options would
be better for you. There

660
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:51,360
(Akim)  is one option. Basically,
you will become a co-worker with us.
Simple as that. You have

661
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:57,200
(Akim)  your salary on a regular
basis. Or there is an option where we
pay you on the transactions.

662
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,200
(Akim)  So, you have two options
here. It depends really what you want to
do.

663
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,440
(Fiorella)  So, a worker, and the
other one is?

664
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,840
(Akim)  Paid on transactions.

665
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,520
(Ysam)  Be a trader. I mean, on
transactions. You get commission on each
transaction.

666
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:14,660
(Fiorella)  Okay.

667
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,520
(Ysam)  And yes, like we explained
in all these hours, yes, we have to
build the best catalog we can

668
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:33,760
(Ysam)  and then to always provide
to our customer the best product we can
get from Peru. Always the

669
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,600
(Ysam)  right quantity, the right
quality. And even if sometimes we have
to work with small and medium

670
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:47,360
(Ysam)  producer or sometimes the
farmer. At that time, we have the
request from the customer. We always

671
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:52,560
(Ysam)  have someone in Peru to
provide if we can. Of course, we can if
there is no product. But at

672
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:59,120
(Ysam)  that time, it's always to
find the best way to provide. At the
end, the most important. As you

673
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:07,680
(Ysam)  see, finally, against the
market, what customers want now is the
quality. We got from Mongophobia,

674
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:14,000
(Ysam)  they won finally. They are
pushing to get quality from Peru and
from other countries. Not only Peru,

675
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,680
(Ysam)  but Peru is one of the
countries where we can get the quality
comparing to other ones.

676
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,920
(Ysam)  Ah, yes, you can see your
screen.

677
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,360
(Akim)  Oh, yeah. We can see your
screen.

678
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,120
(Fiorella)  Ah, yeah. I can share the
information about the dry products.

679
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,720
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

680
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,080
(Fiorella)  Did you know about the
quinoa?

681
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,300
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

682
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,360
(Ysam)  Just a question for the
quinoa just to introduce. They can
provide quinoa in the – I mean,

683
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:48,640
(Ysam)  it's for wholesaler or
they can provide it with a small – like
buy one kilogram with a brand.

684
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,600
(Ysam)  They can do that or no?

685
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,640
(Fiorella)  For both. Whole food
service and retail. We can provide it.

686
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,080
(Ysam)  Okay. If so, tomorrow, a
customer asks you, for example, to put
his brand and everything.

687
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,400
(Ysam)  It's possible to do it in
Peru, to package and everything?

688
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,360
(Fiorella)  Yeah. We can work with a
private label.

689
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,880
(Fiorella)  Okay.

690
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:14,320
(Fiorella)  But take in mind that it's
very important that quantity because
they are a minimum quantity

691
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,200
(Fiorella)  to produce because…

692
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,920
(Fiorella)  Yeah, of course.

693
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:22,960
(Fiorella)  … they have a minimum
quantity to produce and also for the
line.

694
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,120
(Ysam)  Okay. No, but just an
example, to give you an example, that
kind of product,

695
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,120
(Ysam)  I think if we have a
request from a customer, it will be not
for one shot. It will be for

696
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,200
(Ysam)  long-term contract. That's
why we need some very strong producer,
you know?

697
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,320
(Fiorella)  Yeah. And also, there are
many companies that they can produce and
retail

698
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:51,360
(Fiorella)  in toy pack or small boxes
for white, red, black, or tricolor
quinoa.

699
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:59,440
(Fiorella)  And also, not quinoa only
because we can work with chia and
amaranth.

700
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,460
(Fiorella)  Okay.

701
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,060
(Fiorella)  Coffee?

702
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,340
(Akim)  Coffee. Okay.

703
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:21,140
(Fiorella)  As I mentioned, we can
work with green coffee or roasted
coffee. But keep in mind that this
coffee

704
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:26,580
(Fiorella)  is a special coffee due to
the highland and the cup of excellence.

705
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,340
(Akim)  Okay. And Issam told me,
if you go back a few seconds, Issam told
me that this coffee is

706
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:36,500
(Akim)  mainly for Japan or what?
Or do you serve other coffee?

707
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:42,100
(Ysam)  No, I think for the other
one, what I saw for Japan is the other
one.

708
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,220
(Ysam)  The other one?

709
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,260
(Ysam)  Yeah, small portion. I
think, can you explain the difference
between the

710
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,820
(Ysam)  green one and roasted one?

711
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,260
(Fiorella)  Green one is a raw
material.

712
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:54,980
(Ysam)  Okay.

713
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,340
(Fiorella)  You can use a toasted.

714
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:57,960
(Fiorella)  Okay.

715
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:05,700
(Fiorella)  Yeah. And also, it depends
on the customer. The toasted is totally
different.

716
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:12,260
(Fiorella)  Because in Europe, in USA,
and in Asia, the toasted is not similar.
It's medium, it's high.

717
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,540
(Fiorella)  So, it depends on the
customer.

718
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,420
(Ysam)  Yeah. Okay. Okay. No, I
think Akeem was asking about the Japan
because when I've been in

719
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:27,620
(Ysam)  Pichanaki, we just visited
some supplier and we were asking about
his production of coffee.

720
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:33,620
(Ysam)  And he was telling us, you
have no stock because all his stock go
to one customer in Japan.

721
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:38,500
(Ysam)  That's why he was asking
about the... It was one customer, we
visited one producer,

722
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:45,380
(Ysam)  we visited Pichanaki. So,
it was the... But anyway, I think you
remember the coffee you...

723
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:53,620
(Fiorella)  The special coffee that
the animals eat the coffee and then they
produce special coffee?

724
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,900
(Ysam)  I don't know. I was going
to ask you if you remember the coffee
you gave to me before I

725
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,940
(Ysam)  come back to Europe? You
bring me coffee and chocolate. Yeah, do
you remember? This kind of

726
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:09,540
(Ysam)  quality we need, you know?
It was very nice. So, even with the
packaging and everything,

727
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,140
(Ysam)  it was the kind of product
we will need in the catalog.

728
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:27,460
(Fiorella)  Yeah. The best coffee is
you can notice how the coffee is good

729
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:40,580
(Fiorella)  according to the score.
The score of excellence. Because if the
cup of excellence is major to the

730
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:50,420
(Fiorella)  85%, it's good. Here in
Peru, we specialize in special coffees
again.

731
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:59,220
(Fiorella)  And it depends on the
region that they produce. It's very
particular. The flavor, the taste,

732
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:10,340
(Fiorella)  and the smell is totally
different. So, we can take one or two or
three producers and

733
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:19,700
(Fiorella)  taste how is the best for
each customer. Yeah. But in that case
for the coffee area,

734
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:26,980
(Ysam)  because I know that for
each sector, there are different
logistics. For the coffee area,

735
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:32,580
(Ysam)  from the producer to
logistics and everything, it's strong.
You can find many small and medium

736
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:37,140
(Ysam)  companies that are strong
on that side. They can provide. I know
it.

737
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:52,260
(Fiorella)  I know it. Cocoa. We can
do cocoa beans, organic, roasted. And in
this cocoa, I have

738
00:57:52,820 --> 00:58:00,100
(Fiorella)  a special area that they
are

739
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:14,340
(Fiorella)  a community from their
jungle that they produce a special
cocoa. And they have

740
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:21,060
(Fiorella)  an investment or a support
from one program from Europe.

741
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:32,100
(Fiorella)  Oh, really? Okay. We can
sell it, this product, such a social
responsibility and that we can help

742
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:38,180
(Akim)  to this kind of community.
Okay. Makes sense. If you can have that
information, that will be great.

743
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:44,100
(Fiorella)  Yeah. Telling the story
about this community, AshaNink as a
community,

744
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:50,180
(Fiorella)  we can help. If we sell
this product, we can help this
community.

745
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:57,860
(Ysam)  Yeah. As you come back to
the question of Hakeem before, to have
this kind of information in live,

746
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,660
(Ysam)  we can show to the whole
customer. It's not only the product.
It's what's behind.

747
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,860
(Ysam)  It's more than selling.
Yeah, exactly.

748
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,820
(Ysam)  It's all the story. It's
very something. Let's say, for instance,
this community,

749
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,420
(Akim)  you go there, you make a
video with them. That will be great.
Like that, we can say,

750
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:18,020
(Akim)  hey, how coffee is not
just a coffee. It's helping your
community out there,

751
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:25,140
(Akim)  building their own
ecosystem, buildings, whatever. We are
helping the community through the coffee

752
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,940
(Akim)  and they are doing a
special coffee. And by the way, the
coffee is one of the best of Peru. It's

753
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:36,660
(Akim)  a high quality coffee. You
see, there is a whole story behind that.
And by the way, Fiorella,

754
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,820
(Akim)  I like your slides. Thank
you very much for presenting. But do you
have

755
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:45,700
(Akim)  this kind of slides for
fruits and vegetables also? Yeah, I
have.

756
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:53,620
(Akim)  Okay. Can you share the
deck after with us? Like that, we can
review that.

757
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,980
(Fiorella)  Also, I forgot that we
have organic turmeric, fresh organic
turmeric.

758
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:06,180
(Fiorella)  Curcumites, yes. And we
can do a mix palette from ginger and
turmeric from

759
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:14,420
(Fiorella)  Satipo, from Pichanaki. I
have a company that export with all
certificates and it's very

760
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,820
(Fiorella)  strong in this product. Is
it fresh?

761
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:28,900
(Fiorella)  No, this is fresh, but I
can get fresh because I have a producer
and exporter in turmeric,

762
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:34,180
(Akim)  and also ginger, fresh.
Ginger, okay. And I've seen Maca. Can
you go back

763
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,300
(Ysam)  to Maca a few seconds?
Yeah. It's very interesting also, yeah.

764
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,100
(Ysam)  Maca, this one.

765
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,220
(Ysam)  Peruvian ginseng, yeah.

766
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,900
(Ysam)  It's like ginseng, yeah.

767
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,740
(Akim)  Yeah, that's it. That's
important.

768
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,740
(Ysam)  I taste them, it's a very,
very nice product.

769
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,220
(Fiorella)  It's a Peruvian ginseng.

770
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,020
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's
call it like this.

771
01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:01,300
(Ysam)  Yeah, but as you saw it in
the, everyone, if you saw the region,
Honin, this region

772
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:08,500
(Ysam)  produced a lot of the best
products, like ginseng and ginger, and
all found this very,

773
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,540
(Ysam)  very, very nice product.

774
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:18,020
(Akim)  And is it, Fiorella, is it
kind of behind each product there is a
producer and a community,

775
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:22,340
(Akim)  or it depends on the
products? Sometimes there is a community
and sometimes not.

776
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,460
(Fiorella)  What, what, what again?
It's different producers.

777
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,500
(Fiorella)  Okay. Some of them, they
have

778
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:39,540
(Fiorella)  together coffee and
chocolate, or maybe Maca and quinoa, but
it's different.

779
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,060
(Akim)  Okay, got it.

780
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,020
(Akim)  Camu, Camu, Camu, what's
that?

781
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,860
(Fiorella)  It's a tropical fruit.

782
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,100
(Fiorella)  Okay.

783
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,420
(Fiorella)  It's acid, very acid.

784
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,540
(Ysam)  It's like passion fruit,
no? It's same taste, let's say, no?

785
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,740
(Ysam)  Passion fruit, you open
it, no, it's different?

786
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,700
(Ysam)  No, it's different.

787
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,540
(Ysam)  No, it's not different?
Because I taste it, I see.

788
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:03,140
(Fiorella)  Passion fruit is like a
sour, sweet and...

789
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,260
(Ysam)  Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

790
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,180
(Fiorella)  But Camu, Camu, it's very
acid.

791
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:07,460
(Ysam)  Okay, okay.

792
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,460
(Fiorella)  And they contain a high,
high content of vitamin C.

793
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,500
(Ysam)  Oh, really?

794
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,460
(Ysam)  Yeah, I taste it, yeah.

795
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:14,420
(Ysam)  It's good.

796
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,260
(Fiorella)  It's a tropical, an exotic
fruit from the jungle.

797
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,540
(Ysam)  It's very nice, it's,
yeah, it's...

798
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:23,380
(Akim)  From the jungle? Okay, I
don't know. Christophe, you know that
one?

799
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,220
(Fiorella)  From the jungle.

800
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,020
(Christophe)  What?

801
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,520
(Christophe)  No.

802
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:32,500
(Ysam)  Yeah, you see, this kind
of product, usually you find them only
when you go there.

803
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,860
(Ysam)  You know, it's very...

804
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,980
(Ysam)  When you go in that kind
of place, you find a lot of other
products

805
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:39,060
(Ysam)  where you never saw in the
other place, you know?

806
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,420
(Akim)  But this product is
already in export?

807
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,620
(Akim)  It's already exported out
of Peru or not?

808
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,860
(Fiorella)  It's already exported but
in few quantity.

809
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:58,180
(Fiorella)  You can find this product
in powder, in capsules, both of them,
yeah.

810
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,340
(Ysam)  Okay, but not fresh
usually, it's turmeric.

811
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,500
(Fiorella)  Turmeric in fresh and dry.

812
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,420
(Ysam)  Okay, sorry.

813
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,620
(Fiorella)  Powder and capsules, yeah.

814
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,580
(Fiorella)  Chia, you know chia?

815
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,080
(Fiorella)  Chia.

816
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:20,980
(Fiorella)  And these beans is typical
from...

817
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:22,120
(Ysam)  Ah, yes.

818
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,380
(Fiorella)  Yeah, you can find in
grains.

819
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,180
(Fiorella)  I love it, yeah.

820
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:29,780
(Fiorella)  Flour or powder and also
snacks.

821
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:35,620
(Fiorella)  And this is dried food,
fruit.

822
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,420
(Akim)  You have that also,
excellent.

823
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,060
(Akim)  Excellent, I was looking
for that, excellent.

824
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,420
(Akim)  Okay, you have dried
mango.

825
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:44,920
(Akim)  Okay.

826
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,980
(Fiorella)  Dried mango, dried
pineapple, dried cranberry, yeah.

827
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,540
(Fiorella)  And also ginger.

828
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:56,020
(Akim)  Just if you go back a few
seconds ago.

829
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,140
(Akim)  Yeah, this line.

830
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:03,140
(Akim)  If we, let's say for this
ones, is it possible to have our own
packaging?

831
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:07,300
(Akim)  If I say for instance for
the dried mango, I want to have my own
packaging

832
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,820
(Akim)  with my own label and
brand.

833
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,980
(Akim)  Are you able to do that
over there?

834
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:16,020
(Fiorella)  All is possible with those
of products, but take in mind the
minimum order for each one.

835
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:17,700
(Akim)  Okay.

836
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:23,300
(Fiorella)  Most of them, the export
companies, they can do private label.

837
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:24,440
(Fiorella)  Okay.

838
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:30,100
(Fiorella)  But the idea is to take in
mind the minimum, the mock.

839
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,340
(Akim)  The mock, what is that,
sorry?

840
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,180
(Fiorella)  The minimum order quantity
per each one.

841
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,340
(Akim)  Okay, I see, minimum order
quantity.

842
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:38,900
(Ysam)  Okay, got it.

843
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:43,460
(Ysam)  I can just try ginger, so
yeah, nothing loose, yeah.

844
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:48,100
(Fiorella)  Yeah, this is the
superfood process.

845
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:55,700
(Fiorella)  I think that you can want
to consider this kind of figure or video
in the website, yeah?

846
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,980
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

847
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:01,220
(Akim)  That's the process we want
to show, basically the, yeah, exactly.

848
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,660
(Akim)  And you said you have the
same things for fruits and vegetables.

849
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,500
(Akim)  You have the same catalog.

850
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,660
(Fiorella)  Yeah, let me check,
please.

851
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,060
(Akim)  If you have that, yeah,
that will be perfect.

852
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,820
(Akim)  Because Christophe, we
will take some time during the week

853
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:22,020
(Akim)  to show you what we're
building as a website.

854
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,700
(Akim)  You can review it with
him.

855
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:28,980
(Akim)  And he will also take into
account your requests for the toolings
and so on.

856
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:32,180
(Akim)  We'll be sending you also
a phone like that.

857
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,260
(Akim)  You have everything in
place to start working with us.

858
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:38,820
(Akim)  And yeah, we'll be
building also your own email address,

859
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,540
(Akim)  just working with us all
together, you see?

860
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:44,500
(Akim)  And then once we receive
the products, you say,

861
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,660
(Akim)  ah, this product is
available, this and that.

862
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,660
(Akim)  We start shipping and
selling to Europe.

863
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:49,780
(Akim)  That's the overall idea.

864
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,100
(Akim)  But then we can go into
details, but that's the overall idea.

865
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:53,720
(Akim)  Okay.

866
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,060
(Akim)  Cool.

867
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,260
(Akim)  Christophe, any questions
so far?

868
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,340
(Christophe)  Nope.

869
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:58,980
(Christophe)  No, no, no, no.

870
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,180
(Akim)  Christophe is a big fan of
quinoa and Peruvian products, by the
way, Fiona.

871
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,700
(Christophe)  Cool stuff, yeah.

872
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:09,780
(Christophe)  Even lupin, the seed lupin
at the end, this one,

873
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:15,780
(Christophe)  we find it in a lot of
olive mix in Mediterranean place.

874
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,300
(Akim)  But then also, Fiona, at
some point, once we have built the
catalog,

875
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,220
(Akim)  we need to adapt the
catalog for the countries and the
geographies

876
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,500
(Akim)  because the taste is
different in the Middle East

877
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,980
(Akim)  than in Europe, in Eastern
Europe, et cetera, et cetera.

878
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:34,100
(Akim)  Then depending on the
products,

879
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,140
(Akim)  we really need to adapt
the products to the markets.

880
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,320
(Fiorella)  Okay.

881
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,140
(Ysam)  And just one question,
Fiona, on the grain.

882
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,420
(Ysam)  What about the rice
market?

883
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:48,580
(Fiorella)  Rice market?

884
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,940
(Ysam)  Yeah.

885
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,780
(Ysam)  I mean, the rice products
in Peru.

886
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,620
(Ysam)  Is Procura producing
special rice only

887
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:58,260
(Ysam)  or also producing the
classic rice and exporting?

888
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,460
(Ysam)  I was thinking about that
because it's not famous in France.

889
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,220
(Ysam)  I mean, Peru is not famous
for exporting rice,

890
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,820
(Ysam)  so I was just thinking
about that

891
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,660
(Ysam)  because there are so high
demand for the rice.

892
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:16,340
(Fiorella)  We have rice, but I don't
know the variety.

893
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:19,220
(Fiorella)  I know we have a lot of
rice here,

894
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,340
(Fiorella)  but I don't know the
variety exactly.

895
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,260
(Fiorella)  But I don't know the
variety exactly,

896
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,980
(Fiorella)  and there are a big
company.

897
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,540
(Fiorella)  Well, there are a lot,

898
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:33,380
(Fiorella)  but I know a big company
that is called Indoamerica,

899
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:37,700
(Fiorella)  and this company exports
rice,

900
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:46,580
(Fiorella)  but not like a peel of
arborio, no?

901
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:48,740
(Fiorella)  Let me check.

902
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,580
(Akim)  And you remind me of
something, Isamor.

903
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,260
(Akim)  Do you have potatoes in
Peru?

904
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:55,400
(Akim)  Yeah.

905
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:56,920
(Fiorella)  A lot of.

906
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:58,440
(Ysam)  Excellent.

907
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,860
(Fiorella)  A lot of potatoes.

908
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:05,060
(Akim)  Yeah, but that's important
because one of our customers

909
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,220
(Akim)  is asking for potatoes, so
that's why.

910
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,500
(Fiorella)  And also, the main
difference that we have here in Peru

911
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,740
(Fiorella)  is the native potatoes.

912
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:13,240
(Fiorella)  Okay.

913
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,280
(Fiorella)  We have two colors, yes,

914
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,240
(Fiorella)  but we cannot export fresh

915
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,680
(Fiorella)  because we don't have the
protocol.

916
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,320
(Fiorella)  So, we can export in
chips, in snacks.

917
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,520
(Akim)  In chips?

918
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,320
(Akim)  Okay, why not?

919
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,040
(Akim)  Okay, let's see.

920
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,360
(Akim)  Because what we want to
build

921
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,480
(Akim)  is also to build a
specific catalog for potatoes.

922
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,640
(Akim)  So, if you have info
around that, that would be cool.

923
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:39,820
(Fiorella)  Okay.

924
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:46,540
(Fiorella)  The name of this company
that exports rice is Indoamerica.

925
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,180
(Akim)  You can put it on the chat
if you want.

926
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,940
(Akim)  There is a chat, if you
can.

927
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,220
(Akim)  And by the way, what time
is it in?

928
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,980
(Fiorella)  Here is 11.

929
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,420
(Akim)  11, okay.

930
01:08:59,420 --> 01:08:59,920
(Akim)  In the morning?

931
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,500
(Fiorella)  In the morning, yeah.

932
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,000
(Akim)  Okay, cool.

933
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,820
(Akim)  Like that, we know next
time.

934
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:07,580
(Fiorella)  The difference from your,
it's seven hours, maybe?

935
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,220
(Ysam)  Seven hours, yeah.

936
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,020
(Ysam)  Yeah, seven hours.

937
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:09,520
Okay.

938
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,740
(Fiorella)  Well, here we have the
presentation for fresh fruits.

939
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:19,500
(Fiorella)  I think the most important
in this is the calendar.

940
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,260
(Fiorella)  Like this?

941
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,220
(Ysam)  Yeah, exactly.

942
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,100
(Ysam)  Very nice, yeah.

943
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:23,600
(Ysam)  Yeah.

944
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:25,900
(Akim)  Okay, mango,

945
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,240
(Akim)  mango,

946
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,460
(Akim)  October, November,
December.

947
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,500
(Ysam)  Just a question about the
calendar.

948
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,700
(Ysam)  This is only for hair?

949
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,060
(Ysam)  By hair or it's fixed?

950
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,060
(Ysam)  I saw avocado.

951
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,640
(Ysam)  Avocado.

952
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:43,100
(Ysam)  It's avocado quality by
hair or maritimo?

953
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,620
(Ysam)  It's mixed, it's together
or?

954
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,060
(Fiorella)  It's a mix.

955
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,500
(Fiorella)  Because this catalog is
for one of the product,

956
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,420
(Fiorella)  one of the company that I
worked at two years ago

957
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,780
(Fiorella)  and I prepared this kind
of presentation for my customers.

958
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,860
(Ysam)  Yeah, so example, we have
one very nice product, lemon.

959
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,380
(Ysam)  So is the green one or
yellow one?

960
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,220
(Ysam)  Or you can have both?

961
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,820
(Ysam)  Because it's good, because
you can have-

962
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,020
(Fiorella)  Here is the green one.

963
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,020
(Ysam)  Okay, green one, nice.

964
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:14,380
(Fiorella)  You know that this kind of
lime as a lime?

965
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,540
(Fiorella)  Not a lemon, yeah, lime.

966
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:23,100
(Fiorella)  Because for you is green
is lima, yes?

967
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:24,960
(Ysam)  Yeah.

968
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,260
(Fiorella)  That is acid, yeah.

969
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:33,180
(Fiorella)  And we have two varieties
in lime, taity and sutil.

970
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,060
(Ysam)  Taity, sutil.

971
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,980
(Fiorella)  This is the variety, the
lime.

972
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,580
(Ysam)  And so, an example for if
you check that product, the green lime,

973
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,420
(Ysam)  some things you can find,
producer out there packaging everything,

974
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:48,060
(Ysam)  they are there to provide,
there is no problem on that product.

975
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:54,780
(Fiorella)  They export in boxes from
14 kilograms.

976
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:56,940
(Ysam)  14, okay.

977
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,900
(Akim)  And for instance, when you
say mango, it's mango,

978
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,900
(Akim)  it could be Kent or it
could be Edward, right?

979
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,500
(Akim)  The season is the same,
basically, okay.

980
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,460
(Akim)  And avocado, it's mainly
us?

981
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:16,700
(Fiorella)  Avocados during the year,
as I mentioned, we have an early season

982
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:21,020
(Fiorella)  that started in February
to April or March,

983
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:26,620
(Fiorella)  but there are some
companies that they produce to the
farmers in the one area.

984
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:33,340
(Fiorella)  And the other area is at
the north that they produce from June,
July to February.

985
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:39,340
(Fiorella)  But most of them, we have
avocados around the year.

986
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,980
(Akim)  Okay, got it, got it.

987
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:43,840
(Akim)  Okay.

988
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,220
(Akim)  What else, yeah, okay.

989
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:48,860
(Akim)  How about packing?

990
01:11:49,660 --> 01:12:01,900
(Fiorella)  The packing house and
well, the certificates and they ship by
air and by sea.

991
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:05,420
(Fiorella)  Yeah, that's it.

992
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,380
(Akim)  Just a quick question,
Fiorella.

993
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:14,380
(Akim)  If you go back to the
season slide, please, where is, for
instance,

994
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,100
(Akim)  you don't have grapes on
it, you don't have berries,

995
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,540
(Akim)  you don't have this type
of products.

996
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:26,140
(Akim)  Do you have a specific one
for those products or you have to build
it, basically?

997
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:33,100
(Fiorella)  Oh, berries, we just
started in July, July to December, June.

998
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:33,600
(Fiorella)  Okay.

999
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:39,660
(Fiorella)  When you mentioned
berries, are you referring to
blueberries?

1000
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,020
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, exactly,
blueberries.

1001
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,860
(Fiorella)  From July to June.

1002
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:44,140
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1003
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:51,900
(Fiorella)  The peak of this season is
September, September until December.

1004
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,100
(Fiorella)  This is the peak of
season.

1005
01:12:54,540 --> 01:13:00,540
(Fiorella)  But the demand of the
blueberries is very high.

1006
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:13,500
(Fiorella)  So, we need to negotiate
with time before three or six months
before the season.

1007
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:19,420
(Fiorella)  It's very, very, they have
a high demand from blueberries.

1008
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,540
(Akim)  For blueberries.

1009
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:29,740
(Fiorella)  Now, I don't know if we
can do something with some companies
because there are

1010
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:39,420
(Fiorella)  a lot of companies, but
they have a program with their customers
from China, from Europe, from USA.

1011
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,300
(Akim)  Okay, I see what you mean.

1012
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,140
(Akim)  And what about grapes?

1013
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,340
(Akim)  Red ones and the white
ones?

1014
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:58,140
(Fiorella)  The season from grapes is
starting in October, September, last of
September, October until

1015
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,500
(Fiorella)  February, February, March.

1016
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:07,020
(Fiorella)  Because here in Peru,
grapes, there are produces in two areas,
at the north and south.

1017
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:16,940
(Fiorella)  So, we have available from
two areas, from Trujillo, Chiclayo,
almost, you know some.

1018
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:22,780
(Fiorella)  And the other part is
Anca, Xnepeña, the north.

1019
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:29,580
(Akim)  Okay, and where are those
grapes sold the most?

1020
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:35,180
(Akim)  Are they sold the most in
Europe or in the US or where are they
sold?

1021
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:39,420
(Akim)  Because we don't see them
too much in Europe, I mean, the grapes
from Peru.

1022
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,900
(Ysam)  In Europe, not a lot
because, I mean, I think it's in terms
of quantity, I think.

1023
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:52,780
(Ysam)  Maybe, I think, can they
provide, I mean, grapes from Peru, can
they provide a big volume?

1024
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:59,580
(Ysam)  Because, for example, what
the volume we got is, for example, from
Asia, a lot of big volume

1025
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:00,700
(Ysam)  come to Europe.

1026
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:06,060
(Ysam)  Can, for example, if
tomorrow we need a big volume in long
term for a few months, can

1027
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,260
(Ysam)  we get that from Peru?

1028
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:13,500
(Ysam)  Or it's something
complicated because all the farmers are
together to bring all together

1029
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:13,980
(Ysam)  the volume.

1030
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:19,100
(Fiorella)  And it depends the
situation of the international market,
because if there are a lot of produce

1031
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:28,460
(Fiorella)  in United States and they
have their own fruit, Peruvian
exporters, they decide to export

1032
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,340
(Fiorella)  to Mexico or to Europe or
Asia.

1033
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,380
(Fiorella)  It depends on the
international market and how is the
demand.

1034
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:45,820
(Fiorella)  Also, if the prices in
China or in Asia is very good today, and
if they arrive until

1035
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:49,660
(Fiorella)  the Chinese year, it's
very good because the prices is very
high.

1036
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:53,180
(Fiorella)  So, it depends how is the
behavior of the market.

1037
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,180
(Akim)  Okay, good.

1038
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:02,620
(Akim)  And, okay, and for the
potatoes, you have a specific set of
variety of potatoes over

1039
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:02,860
(Akim)  there.

1040
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:04,540
(Akim)  You say native potatoes
and so on.

1041
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:07,260
(Akim)  You have a lot of variety
of potatoes over there in Peru?

1042
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,940
(Fiorella)  Yeah, a lot of potatoes.

1043
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:11,500
(Fiorella)  I don't know.

1044
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,580
(Akim)  Is it like you have 50
varieties of potatoes or more?

1045
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,580
(Fiorella)  More than 1,000.

1046
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:19,340
(Akim)  Wow, okay.

1047
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:25,500
(Fiorella)  But we can export fresh
because we don't have protocols.

1048
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:31,980
(Fiorella)  So, we can export directly
to the international market only for
snacks.

1049
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:46,460
(Fiorella)  I think it's a good
business to export or import and do
strategic partners with the

1050
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:49,420
(Fiorella)  hotels or distributors.

1051
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:54,540
(Fiorella)  I mean hotels because, you
know, if you are waiting in the bar or
in the restaurant, you

1052
01:16:54,540 --> 01:17:05,340
(Fiorella)  can snack in potatoes and
it's very common to check nuts, but it's
very different to

1053
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:08,060
(Fiorella)  offer potatoes.

1054
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:14,860
(Fiorella)  And if it is from full
color, red or blue color is totally
different.

1055
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:21,100
(Fiorella)  Let me check what is the
name of the potatoes that we eat, the
native ones.

1056
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:28,620
(Akim)  We have, this is a good
point, Fiola, this is one of our
targets.

1057
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:33,660
(Akim)  Of course, we are
targeting, we are working with
supermarkets, but hotels is one of our

1058
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:33,980
(Akim)  targets.

1059
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,740
(Akim)  But we are targeting five-
star hotels only, you see?

1060
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:37,900
(Akim)  Yes.

1061
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,220
(Akim)  We are targeting high-
quality hotels.

1062
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:43,340
(Akim)  I mean the rest we don't
care, but five-star hotels.

1063
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:47,500
(Akim)  And we have a lot in the,
and Sam knows that and Christophe as
well.

1064
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:52,780
(Akim)  We have a lot of five-star
hotels in France, especially in the
south of France.

1065
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:56,140
(Akim)  You know, when you go to
Nice, Monaco, you have a lot of, and
Cannes, you have a lot

1066
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:59,500
(Akim)  of five-star hotels that
we can target with this kind of product.

1067
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,860
(Akim)  So that's why that would
be interesting.

1068
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:05,900
(Fiorella)  This is of the kind of
product, the potatoes.

1069
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:07,740
(Fiorella)  Check the color.

1070
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:21,820
(Fiorella)  It's very nice and it's
sweetened and it's fried with a special
oil without a preservant,

1071
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:22,300
(Fiorella)  I think.

1072
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:44,380
(Fiorella)  And we can, I can produce
with private label, but the, the
quantity of the, of these bags

1073
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:53,180
(Fiorella)  is very, very big because
they import in bobbins of plastic and
they need to use all

1074
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,740
(Fiorella)  the, one bobbin that is a
lot of product.

1075
01:18:55,740 --> 01:19:02,700
(Fiorella)  So we can import directly
with this brand, or there are another
company that export and

1076
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:09,020
(Fiorella)  they produce for French
company.

1077
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:11,900
(Akim)  Which one?

1078
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,100
(Akim)  You know?

1079
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,860
(Fiorella)  Yeah, I know it, but I
don't know it now.

1080
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:19,980
(Akim)  Sure, yeah, no worries.

1081
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:20,540
(Akim)  Take your time.

1082
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:22,780
(Akim)  What comes to France?

1083
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:23,340
(Akim)  Let us know.

1084
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:28,300
(Akim)  We are very well known in
France and we can target all the French
market, as you can imagine.

1085
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:33,900
(Akim)  But if you give us the
name, we can definitely be interested to
hear more.

1086
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:35,900
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1087
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:37,980
(Fiorella)  Good.

1088
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:41,020
(Fiorella)  Eco, how is it?

1089
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,260
(Fiorella)  Here is eco-friendly.

1090
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:45,820
(Fiorella)  No.

1091
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:56,780
(Fiorella)  Appropriate.

1092
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:05,740
(Akim)  And by the way, just a
quick question like this, do you see a
lot of

1093
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:09,500
(Akim)  French and European
companies in Peru so far exporting or
not?

1094
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:11,900
(Fiorella)  Could you repeat?

1095
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:12,940
(Fiorella)  I can listen well.

1096
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:17,740
(Akim)  No, I said, do you see a
lot of French and European companies in
Peru that wants to export

1097
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,260
(Akim)  these days or not?

1098
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,140
(Fiorella)  No, not a lot.

1099
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:22,780
Okay.

1100
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,220
(Fiorella)  Only from Chile.

1101
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:27,580
(Akim)  Chile?

1102
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,540
(Fiorella)  Some from Spain.

1103
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:29,340
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1104
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,980
(Fiorella)  But from French, no.

1105
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:33,020
Okay.

1106
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,380
(Fiorella)  Oh, there are some chips
of quinoa also.

1107
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,020
(Akim)  Ah, interesting.

1108
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:39,820
(Akim)  Do you like this stuff?

1109
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:40,940
(Akim)  Yes.

1110
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,020
(Akim)  Pasta.

1111
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:44,140
(Akim)  Pasta.

1112
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:45,180
(Akim)  Okay.

1113
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:49,100
(Fiorella)  Coffee.

1114
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,140
(Fiorella)  It's coffee.

1115
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:56,700
(Christophe)  You have both kind of
quinoa, red one and usual one also?

1116
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,540
(Fiorella)  White, red, black,
tricolour.

1117
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:02,220
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1118
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:03,820
(Ysam)  Right.

1119
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,380
(Ysam)  In Peru, you have the
choice of the colour.

1120
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:18,460
(Fiorella)  They produce native
potatoes, a banana, a snack from banana,
and also sweet potatoes.

1121
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:21,500
(Fiorella)  This is nothing English.

1122
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,460
(Christophe)  And what about lentils?

1123
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:43,180
(Christophe)  Because now that I see
that you do quinoa chips in France and
South Europe, it's the

1124
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,500
(Christophe)  rise of chips from
lentils.

1125
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:52,140
(Christophe)  And we don't see any chips
of quinoa or maybe I'm wrong, guys?

1126
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,660
(Christophe)  Have you ever seen this in
market?

1127
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,140
(Christophe)  No, no, no.

1128
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,020
(Akim)  It's the first time I see
this.

1129
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,300
(Akim)  Quinoa chips, it's the
first time.

1130
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,300
(Christophe)  We see lentil chips
everywhere.

1131
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,100
(Christophe)  Every time I go to work.

1132
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,660
(Christophe)  Quinoa chips, it's a box
everywhere.

1133
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,460
(Christophe)  Exactly.

1134
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,100
(Christophe)  There aren't any at all.

1135
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,580
(Christophe)  And everyone brings their
lentil chips now.

1136
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:06,860
(Christophe)  It's the new hype, you
know?

1137
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,260
(Akim)  Quinoa chips, it's a must.

1138
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,740
(Akim)  Are you in contact with
this company, Fiorella?

1139
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:12,700
(Akim)  This one?

1140
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:13,660
(Akim)  Tia Pouy?

1141
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,700
(Akim)  Tia Pouy?

1142
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:15,660
(Fiorella)  This company?

1143
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:15,900
(Akim)  Yeah.

1144
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:17,580
(Fiorella)  I can contact.

1145
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:25,820
(Fiorella)  I have another contact
with this similar company that they
produce potatoes, native

1146
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,660
(Fiorella)  potatoes in Huancavelica.

1147
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:28,700
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1148
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:38,060
(Fiorella)  I know that they export
directly to France and Europe because
they work directly with,

1149
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:40,460
(Fiorella)  I don't remember the name.

1150
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,780
(Akim)  Oh, Fiorella.

1151
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:43,340
(Akim)  What happens?

1152
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,780
(Fiorella)  My business is fresh now,
so I don't remember.

1153
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:47,660
(Fiorella)  Sorry.

1154
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,500
(Akim)  I'm joking, I'm joking,
I'm joking.

1155
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:55,980
(Akim)  But that's why it's
important to give you all the tooling.

1156
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:59,660
(Akim)  You see like that, when
you search for something, you have your
notes and this and that.

1157
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:02,140
(Akim)  So we'll discuss that with
Christophe afterwards.

1158
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,260
(Akim)  Okay, cool.

1159
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:08,460
(Ysam)  Yes.

1160
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:14,540
(Ysam)  And one good thing is, as
you saw, for a lot of products, you can
have many colors, you

1161
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:14,700
(Ysam)  know?

1162
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,540
(Ysam)  You can pick the colors
you want.

1163
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:16,780
(Ysam)  Yeah.

1164
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:19,740
(Ysam)  For marketing, it's very
important, you know?

1165
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:20,940
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1166
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:21,500
(Ysam)  It's natural.

1167
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,100
(Ysam)  Yeah.

1168
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,260
(Ysam)  For quinoa, for potatoes,
you can have different colors, you know?

1169
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:31,740
(Ysam)  And sometimes I think, oh,
Christophe, you will want to buy color
and not sometimes,

1170
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,780
(Ysam)  not even the special
taste, but color first and then.

1171
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:41,180
(Christophe)  Yeah, I'm interested by
the blue potato I've heard, so this
could be very cool.

1172
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:47,500
(Fiorella)  The company that I
mentioned is called Agropia, and this
company is a cooperative.

1173
01:23:48,220 --> 01:24:00,380
(Fiorella)  And I remember that I
worked on a project because I'm very
creative in preparing label,

1174
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:04,860
(Fiorella)  packaging, and so forth,
but I'm trying to do new recipes.

1175
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:13,660
(Fiorella)  So when I do this project
with some friends that they sell dry
products in Europe, in

1176
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:23,100
(Fiorella)  Germany, we propose to
this company to do a mix of chips from
native potatoes with

1177
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:26,940
(Fiorella)  carrots.

1178
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:34,060
(Fiorella)  And the other one is,
Peruvian name is betarraba, how do you
say betarraba in English?

1179
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:34,540
(Fiorella)  Betarraba.

1180
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,060
(Fiorella)  Betabel.

1181
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:37,260
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1182
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:38,300
(Christophe)  Okay, okay.

1183
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,660
(Christophe)  Beet in English and
betarraba in French.

1184
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:42,460
(Fiorella)  Uh-huh.

1185
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:50,700
(Fiorella)  So we can do this mix
because it's new, native potatoes with
carrots and betabel,

1186
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:58,060
(Fiorella)  or mix of potatoes from
blue and red native potatoes.

1187
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:02,860
(Fiorella)  And also they produce
yayan corn from Cusco.

1188
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:04,460
(Akim)  What's that?

1189
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:05,420
(Akim)  Sorry, I don't know that.

1190
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:06,140

(Akim)  Sorry, Fiorella, we don't
know all the...

1196
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,820

a corn, but...

01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,860
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, but a specific
one, I guess.

(Fiorella)  A big corn, a big corn
specific from Cusco, from a region...

1199
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,140
(Ysam)  Yayan corn is a special

1200
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,900
(Ysam)  Oh, it's a special.

1201

(Ysam)  Andean tubers.

1235
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:00,460
(Fiorella)  Andean tubers is a special
or a kind of potatoes.

1236
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:01,260
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1237
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:07,340
(Fiorella)  As I mentioned, potatoes
with any colors, any forms, varieties.

1238
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:17,100
(Fiorella)  And the other special
tubercles is Andean mashua, because it's
a sweet and it's very

1239
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,700
(Fiorella)  different, and oca.

1240
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:22,540
(Fiorella)  And this is oyuko, another
Andean tubers.

1241
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:24,700
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1242
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:28,300
(Fiorella)  This is very typical from
the Incas.

1243
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:33,740
(Fiorella)  They eat this kind of
tubers from Incas, yeah.

1244
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:37,500
(Fiorella)  And the giant corn is this
corn here.

1245
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:39,980
(Ysam)  Yeah, I think I put it
here.

1246
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:44,380
(Ysam)  So, basically, this
cooperative is something strong.

1247
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,740
(Ysam)  If they are serious and
everything, so they are working, no
problem.

1248
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:48,780
(Ysam)  We can make business with
them.

1249
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:50,780
(Fiorella)  No, they export.

1250
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,580
(Fiorella)  They export.

1251
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:55,820
(Fiorella)  And if you come to Peru,
we can visit in one capitalica.

1252
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:56,620
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1253
01:27:57,660 --> 01:27:58,780
(Fiorella)  This is giant corn.

1254
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:03,020
(Akim)  If we want, let's say, to
have our own brand and label, we can do
that as well.

1255
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,020
(Akim)  Okay.

1256
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:06,060
(Akim)  That's what you mean.

1257
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:09,580
(Fiorella)  Yeah, but take in mind the
volume, the minimum order.

1258
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:09,980
(Fiorella)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,260
(Akim)  Minimum, I understand.

1260
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:11,660
(Akim)  Minimum order.

1261
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,620
(Fiorella)  This is giant corn.

1262

(Ysam)  No, I think my screen is
the same page.

1264
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,940
(Ysam)  No, it's the same page.

1265
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:23,980
(Ysam)  We can't see it.

1266
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:24,940
(Ysam)  I think it's frozen.

1267
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:26,540
(Ysam)  Yeah, I can do it again.

1268
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:26,780
(Ysam)  Yeah.

1269
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,500
(Ysam)  I'm still stuck in the
page with the product.

1270
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,300
(Ysam)  Ah, yes, now it's fine.

1271
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:33,020
(Ysam)  That's why, okay.

1272
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:37,660
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1273
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:38,460
(Ysam)  Yeah, no, it's fine.

1274
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,180
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah.

1275
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,460
(Ysam)  Corn, maize, giant.

1276
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:41,180
(Ysam)  Maize, giant.

1277
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,580
(Ysam)  Okay.

1278
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:44,380
(Ysam)  It's never saw that.

1279
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:44,620
(Ysam)  Okay.

1280
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,540
(Ysam)  So, this one is corn from
Peru.

1281
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,500
(Ysam)  It's not the classic one.

1282
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:51,260
(Fiorella)  No, it's from Peru and
it's big.

1283
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:53,900
(Ysam)  Okay, okay.

1284
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:54,620
(Ysam)  So, okay.

1285
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:59,740
(Ysam)  So, these things, when we
come to every restaurant, they give to
us to aperitifs.

1286
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:00,220
(Ysam)  It's this one.

1287
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,780
(Ysam)  You know, in Peru, when
you come to the restaurant.

1288
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,380
(Fiorella)  With ceviche?

1289
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:04,780
(Fiorella)  No.

1290
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:06,620
(Ysam)  Yeah, no, it's a different
one.

1291
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:07,740
(Ysam)  With ceviche, it's not.

1292
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,900
(Christophe)  No, it was those colors.

1293
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,900
(Fiorella)  For ceviche, it's small.

1294
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:12,700
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1295
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,100
(Ysam)  This is giant.

1296
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:14,300
(Ysam)  I have much more.

1297
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,900
(Ysam)  Ah, giant, sorry, giant.

1298
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:16,140
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1299
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:21,660
(Fiorella)  Four or five more big than
the other.

1300
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:21,820
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1301
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,220
(Fiorella)  And the taste and flavor
is different.

1302
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,300
(Ysam)  Okay, okay.

1303
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,300
(Ysam)  Okay.

1304
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,540
(Fiorella)  This is the corn.

1305
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:44,780
(Fiorella)  It's different.

1306
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:48,380
(Fiorella)  We have a lot of varieties
of corn also.

1307
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,500
(Akim)  You see, for instance, the
picture before.

1308
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,780
(Akim)  If you go to the picture
before.

1309
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:53,980
(Akim)  Yeah, this one.

1310
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:54,940
(Akim)  No, the farmers.

1311
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:55,660
(Akim)  Yeah, exactly.

1312
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:57,660
(Akim)  This is the type of
communication we want to have.

1313
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:00,300
(Akim)  Basically, you know, the
farmer in the middle.

1314
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,460
(Akim)  If you want to be in the
picture with him, no worries.

1315
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,380
(Akim)  And then, you know, we
say, hey, this is the product.

1316
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,020
(Akim)  This and that.

1317
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:07,420
(Akim)  You see, this is exactly
what is needed.

1318
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:10,460
(Akim)  Because people are looking
to understand what is behind the
products.

1319
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:11,900
(Akim)  And they want to help the
producers.

1320
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:14,940
(Ysam)  And especially that kind
of thing.

1321
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:19,420
(Ysam)  Because like I said, the
customers, especially supermarkets, they
want not just products.

1322
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,860
(Ysam)  They want a full story.

1323
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:22,220
(Ysam)  They want a full project.

1324
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:27,580
(Ysam)  I mean, when they buy
products, they want to buy products to
resell.

1325
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,340
(Ysam)  But also to help the
cooperative.

1326
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,460
(Ysam)  To help this country, the
farmer, you know.

1327
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,380
(Ysam)  They want, I mean, they
are buying projects, you know.

1328
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,540
(Ysam)  That's why when they are
buying, they're buying a picture.

1329
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:39,420
(Ysam)  But with the product, with
the story, with everything.

1330
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:40,860
(Ysam)  With the, you know, it's.

1331
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:42,780
(Akim)  That's good.

1332
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,260
(Akim)  That's good.

1333
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:49,900
(Fiorella)  If you create a story
about this situation, it's very nice.

1334
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:54,460
(Fiorella)  Also, it's a commitment
with the area.

1335
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:57,500
(Fiorella)  With the people, with the
families that they live there.

1336
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:06,140
(Fiorella)  And we have to create a
best style of life, yeah.

1337
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,620
(Fiorella)  Well, that's it with
Yayancorn.

1338
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,020
(Fiorella)  The same of the potatoes,
I think.

1339
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,380
(Fiorella)  And there are flavored
chips also.

1340
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:26,880
(Akim)  Oh, really?

1341
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:29,020
(Akim)  They have that?

1342
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:39,180
(Fiorella)  With paprika, with
oregano, and garlic, and peppers also.

1343
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,740
(Fiorella)  This is very takeable, no?

1344
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:45,420
(Fiorella)  Also, we can work with
these products, but in.

1345
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,660
(Akim)  In different brands, okay.

1346
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:51,420
(Fiorella)  Maybe bulk or white or
private label.

1347
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,060
(Akim)  Okay, I see.

1348
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:55,260
(Akim)  Because it takeable is, it
seems to be, I've checked in the
meantime.

1349
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,700
(Akim)  It seems to be a French
company, a cooperative one.

1350
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:00,220
(Akim)  So, they have put their
label on it.

1351
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:04,380
(Akim)  But if we do something, we
probably need to skip this label

1352
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:07,420
(Akim)  and put some event white
label or our label.

1353
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:07,980
(Akim)  Let's see.

1354
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,660
(Akim)  Okay, makes sense.

1355
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:12,860
(Akim)  Okay, good.

1356
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:20,300
(Fiorella)  And the cooperative that I
mentioned for chocolates is there.

1357
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:29,820
(Ysam)  And especially your
chocolate you're doing before, Alferla?

1358
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,220
(Fiorella)  No, this is different.

1359
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:34,780
(Fiorella)  And the chocolate that I
give, the chocolate that I give,

1360
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:36,060
(Fiorella)  it's very, very nice.

1361
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,980
(Fiorella)  Because the differences
are receipts from French.

1362
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:43,900
(Fiorella)  And all of this chocolate
is organic.

1363
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,180
(Fiorella)  It's totally different.

1364
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,660
(Fiorella)  This chocolate, it's
different.

1365
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:56,060
(Fiorella)  But as our way, we want to
promote the social responsibility

1366
01:32:56,060 --> 01:33:00,460
(Fiorella)  and tell the people or
tell the consumer that we are helping

1367
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:05,580
(Fiorella)  to the communities or
areas that they need help.

1368
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,940
(Fiorella)  This company or this, not
just a company.

1369
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:13,420
(Fiorella)  This is a community that
is called Chemito N.

1370
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:20,540
(Fiorella)  And this work directly
with Ashaninka, typical people from this
area

1371
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,060
(Fiorella)  that produce their
chocolates.

1372
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:26,460
(Fiorella)  So, let me check if it is
in English.

1373
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:28,400
(Fiorella)  I don't know.

1374
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,660
(Akim)  That's interesting because
I haven't seen this.

1375
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:37,260
(Akim)  I have not seen this
chocolate in France or in Europe so far.

1376
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:39,100
(Akim)  So, that's interesting.

1377
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,620
(Fiorella)  Real producers from the
world.

1378
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,620
(Fiorella)  Okay, I will translate.

1379
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:55,680
Okay.

1380
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:10,060
(Fiorella)  It's an Ashaninka
community that is in the jungle.

1381
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:15,360
(Fiorella)  Like this.

1382
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:16,560
(Akim)  Okay.

1383
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:18,700
(Fiorella)  Not real faces.

1384
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:22,460
This is America, the vice president of
the association.

1385
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:23,600
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1386
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,660
(Fiorella)  And he's doing this
chocolate.

1387
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:28,160
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1388
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:34,460
(Fiorella)  This community, this
Ashaninka community doing this kind of
chocolates.

1389
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:34,960
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1390
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:38,540
(Fiorella)  The products.

1391
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:40,300
This is the area.

1392
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:41,260
(Fiorella)  The products.

1393
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:43,100
(Fiorella)  This is the area.

1394
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:44,480
(Fiorella)  N.

1395
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:55,580
(Fiorella)  The place is called Rio N.

1396
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:59,260
(Fiorella)  And they live there, yeah.

1397
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:00,880
(Ysam)  Got it.

1398
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:06,700
(Fiorella)  This is the collection of
cocoa, pasta.

1399
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:11,180
(Ysam)  Which region they are?

1400
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:13,680
(Ysam)  What?

1401
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:15,580
(Ysam)  I mean, which part of Peru
they are?

1402
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:16,700
(Ysam)  In the south?

1403
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,260
(Ysam)  I mean, it's one kind or
it's...

1404
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:24,940
(Fiorella)  It's between Hunin.

1405
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:26,300
(Ysam)  Oh, okay.

1406
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,580
(Ysam)  So, okay.

1407
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:28,220
(Ysam)  Okay.

1408
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:28,720
(Ysam)  All right.

1409
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:30,880
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1410
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,220
(Fiorella)  This is bitter chocolate.

1411
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:36,060
(Fiorella)  With milk.

1412
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:37,680
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1413
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:39,260
(Fiorella)  With golden berry.

1414
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,060
(Fiorella)  60%, yeah.

1415
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:44,460
(Fiorella)  With cereals.

1416
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:46,720
(Akim)  Okay.

1417
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:49,820
(Fiorella)  55%.

1418
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,460
(Fiorella)  And with stevia.

1419
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:54,560
(Fiorella)  99%.

1420
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:58,460
(Fiorella)  And they also have coffee.

1421
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,340
(Akim)  Sorry, Fiora.

1422
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:02,700
(Akim)  Why did they put a fish on
the cereals once?

1423
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,380
(Akim)  What is it when you go to
the cereal one?

1424
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,740
(Akim)  Why did they put a fish on
it?

1425
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,020
(Akim)  It's a fish or what?

1426
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:07,520
(Fiorella)  Here?

1427
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:08,560
(Akim)  What's that?

1428
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:14,240
(Fiorella)  Because this kind of fish
lives in this area.

1429
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:15,540
(Fiorella)  Typical...

1430
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,760
(Fiorella)  Typical animals that they
live in this area.

1431
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,960
(Akim)  But what is the link
between the fish and the cereal?

1432
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,720
(Fiorella)  The fish, the name of fish
is Kempiti.

1433
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,000
(Akim)  Ah, okay.

1434
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,520
(Fiorella)  This fish lives in the Ene
River.

1435
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:37,760
(Fiorella)  Or Rio Ene.

1436
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,220
(Fiorella)  This...

1437
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:40,980
(Akim)  Got it.

1438
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,640
(Akim)  Okay, they have put
some...

1439
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,080
(Akim)  In this river.

1440
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,560
(Akim)  Oh, okay.

1441
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,920
(Akim)  Some animals and their
chocolate.

1442
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:46,960
(Fiorella)  Okay, I see.

1443
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,160
(Fiorella)  They want to show the
animals that they live in this area.

1444
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,560
(Fiorella)  Because, as you know, it's
a community.

1445
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,680
(Fiorella)  A typical community from
this part of area.

1446
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,120
(Fiorella)  Call it Rio Ene.

1447
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:00,800
(Akim)  Okay.

1448
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,560
(Akim)  And you said they do
coffee as well.

1449
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,560
(Fiorella)  They do coffee, yes.

1450
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,600
(Fiorella)  They export, but in small
quantities.

1451
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,160
(Fiorella)  And we can...

1452
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,800
(Fiorella)  Do some alliance or...

1453
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,440
(Akim)  Partnership, partnership.

1454
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,160
(Akim)  Okay, okay.

1455
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:17,600
Yeah.

1456
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,720
(Akim)  And are you...

1457
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:22,560
(Akim)  If we work with them, are
you able to go there and to do a video
with them?

1458
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,160
(Akim)  And so on of what they're
doing?

1459
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:24,720
(Akim)  Stuff like this?

1460
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,360
(Akim)  Sure.

1461
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,160
(Akim)  Okay, cool.

1462
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,920
(Fiorella)  Cocoa powder, nibs.

1463
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,800
(Fiorella)  And we can do private
label also.

1464
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,360
(Fiorella)  And the best, the most
important here is that they have organic
certifications.

1465
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:38,820
Okay.

1466
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,040
(Fiorella)  Issam, they are located in
Satipo.

1467
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,040
(Ysam)  Ah, okay.

1468
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,720
(Ysam)  Okay, I've been there,
Satipo, yeah.

1469
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,000
(Ysam)  Close to Xaoha, no?

1470
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:54,720
(Fiorella)  We can travel to Xaoha and
then go with a car to Satipo, yes.

1471
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:55,280
(Ysam)  Yeah, it's better.

1472
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,160
(Ysam)  Because last time, to be
honest, we made it without flight.

1473
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,320
(Ysam)  We spent one day in the
road, you know.

1474
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,080
(Fiorella)  Your friend, your friend,
Ana Lucia.

1475
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,520
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, my friend.

1476
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,040
(Akim)  Yeah, it's because of your
friend.

1477
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,040
(Ysam)  You know, next time I will
take a flight, you know.

1478
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:16,080
(Ysam)  It will be two hours and
then we will go to Xaoha and then to
Satipo.

1479
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,680
(Ysam)  But it was a trip, you
know.

1480
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,680
(Fiorella)  I have my doubts with your
friend, eh?

1481
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:23,040
(Fiorella)  I don't know if she has an
experience of this business.

1482
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,040
(Ysam)  So, what did you say?

1483
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:25,540
(Ysam)  Sorry?

1484
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:30,240
(Fiorella)  I don't know if she has an
experience in this business, your
friend.

1485
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:35,760
(Ysam)  No, yeah, but as you know,
I think she's focused on the mango.

1486
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,520
(Ysam)  And for me, yes.

1487
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:43,440
(Ysam)  I mean, as you know the
history, she keeps doing the same
product, you know.

1488
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:49,600
(Ysam)  She keeps focused on the
mango, so without to explore other
products.

1489
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,380
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1490
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:01,680
(Fiorella)  Well, this is the part of
the area and this is coffee, I think.

1491
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,280
(Fiorella)  Yes, it's coffee, green
coffee.

1492
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:14,240
(Fiorella)  And we can visit together
to this community because it's so
beautiful and the area, it's very nice.

1493
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,440
(Ysam)  It's incredible, yeah.

1494
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,160
(Ysam)  These are great.

1495
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,560
(Ysam)  It's almost a jungle,
yeah.

1496
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,680
(Ysam)  We are in the jungle,
yeah.

1497
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:26,000
(Akim)  And they are kind of like
native Indian people or something like
this?

1498
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,960
(Akim)  What is their roots over
there?

1499
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,640
(Ysam)  Indian, no.

1500
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,600
(Ysam)  No, no, not Indian, no.

1501
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,720
(Ysam)  No, they are Inca, I
think.

1502
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:33,760
(Akim)  Inca, Inca people, yeah.

1503
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,320
(Akim)  Sorry, Inca.

1504
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:34,960
(Akim)  Yeah, it's...

1505
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,440
(Fiorella)  But Inca, not at all Inca
because Inca is different.

1506
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:48,160
(Fiorella)  It is this kind of Inca
but from the jungle because there are
some Incas from the...

1507
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,600
(Fiorella)  The Incas is from the
highland.

1508
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:53,940
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1509
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,500
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1510
01:39:55,460 --> 01:40:03,460
(Fiorella)  And the main harvest of
cacao is from April to August, so we are
on time.

1511
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:05,220
(Akim)  April to August, okay.

1512
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:10,020
(Fiorella)  And I understand that you
want this kind of photos on videos.

1513
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:11,300
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1514
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,700
(Ysam)  I mean, yeah, we want the
reality, you know.

1515
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,220
(Ysam)  That is very important,
you know.

1516
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:17,940
(Akim)  Because otherwise people,
you know, they will not trust us.

1517
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,620
(Akim)  Meaning they say, hey,
what are they selling?

1518
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:21,380
(Akim)  Where are they coming
from?

1519
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,260
(Akim)  This and that.

1520
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:26,260
(Akim)  We need to show the, how
to say that, the back office process.

1521
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:29,540
(Akim)  How do we get those
products, etc, etc.

1522
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:33,060
(Akim)  Yeah, this kind of photos
is exceptional.

1523
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:36,500
(Akim)  And we need to tell the
story saying, okay, we help people.

1524
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,180
(Akim)  When you buy this product,
you help the community behind that.

1525
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:42,580
(Akim)  It's not just chocolate
for chocolate.

1526
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,580
(Akim)  You are helping a whole
community behind that.

1527
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,180
(Akim)  Okay, cool.

1528
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:51,780
(Fiorella)  Yes, and they're helping
to these people, to these families,

1529
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:56,740
(Fiorella)  because they only have
this kind of business for your life.

1530
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:59,460
(Fiorella)  Or for a life, not life,
for a life.

1531
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:03,060
(Fiorella)  Because this is the
subsistence.

1532
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:08,500
(Akim)  Yeah, they do chocolate
and coffee only, right?

1533
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:10,340
(Akim)  They only have that.

1534
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:16,340
(Fiorella)  Chocolate and coffee is a
good opportunity for them to do a better
life.

1535
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,420
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, understood.

1536
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,500
(Akim)  Okay, got it, got it.

1537
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:26,580
(Fiorella)  So, we can work with this
community and the other one,

1538
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,100
(Fiorella)  from Potatoes, with this
community.

1539
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:35,300
(Fiorella)  Because it's smaller than
the other, than the Yapui that I
mentioned.

1540
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,580
(Akim)  Oh, it makes sense.

1541
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:41,780
(Akim)  We want to work, at the
end of the day,

1542
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:43,780
(Akim)  we want to work like this
with communities and products.

1543
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:44,340
(Akim)  So, that's okay.

1544
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:51,140
(Akim)  Good, next step will be
for you, Fiorella, to have a one-to-one
with Christophe.

1545
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:52,100
(Akim)  Right, Christophe?

1546
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:54,260
(Akim)  You will review all the
tooling with Fiorella?

1547
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:56,500
(Christophe)  Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1548
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,660
(Akim)  Well, when do you want to
plan that?

1549
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:01,540
(Akim)  Next week, probably?

1550
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,580
(Christophe)  What fits the most for
Fiorella?

1551
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:10,020
(Christophe)  So, basically, it would be
around the same, I mean, 10, 11 a.m.

1552
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:13,140
(Christophe)  Something like this would
be okay for you?

1553
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:14,500
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1554
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:15,780
(Christophe)  Okay.

1555
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:16,820
(Fiorella)  It'll be an hour, yes?

1556
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:20,500
(Christophe)  Yeah, I mean, 30 minutes
would be enough.

1557
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,620
(Christophe)  30 minutes would be more
than enough.

1558
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:29,060
(Christophe)  Yeah, just basically, we
have been in discussion with people who
were using

1559
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:34,180
(Christophe)  WhatsApp, some other
slacks, and then kind of lose of
information.

1560
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:36,660
(Christophe)  That's just what we want
to avoid, that's all.

1561
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:38,820
(Fiorella)  Okay, yeah.

1562
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:42,260
(Akim)  And we will show you also
the website, what we're building.

1563
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:43,300
(Akim)  Like, that you have…

1564
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:44,660
(Fiorella)  What is the name of the
company?

1565
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:47,380
(Akim)  You want…

1566
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:49,940
(Akim)  It's not defined yet.

1567
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:50,500
(Akim)  It's in process.

1568
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,620
(Ysam)  It's in process.

1569
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:55,700
(Ysam)  That's why we are
separating the name of the company and
also the brand.

1570
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:58,500
(Ysam)  That's why we are also
planning the brand.

1571
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:02,660
(Akim)  So, basically, to give you
an idea, we are building three brands.

1572
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:07,140
(Akim)  One for fruits, one for
exotic fruits, and one for vegetables
only.

1573
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:08,500
(Akim)  So, basically, we have
three brands.

1574
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:13,780
(Akim)  And then, out of this
brand, there will be a bigger company
that will be the holding

1575
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:16,100
(Akim)  and will be doing other
stuff for them.

1576
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:16,660
(Fiorella)  Ah, okay.

1577
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:17,300
(Fiorella)  I got it.

1578
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,740
(Fiorella)  It's like a holding.

1579
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,220
(Akim)  Exactly.

1580
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,340
(Akim)  It's like a holding.

1581
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:26,420
(Akim)  But for Peru, we are
targeting specifically fruits,
vegetables, and, of course, exotic

1582
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:27,860
(Akim)  fruits also.

1583
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:28,260
(Akim)  You see?

1584
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,100
(Akim)  So, we have different
brands for each product.

1585
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:31,220
Okay.

1586
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:34,260
(Fiorella)  From Peru, it's exotic
fruits and the other fruits from Peru.

1587
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:39,140
(Fiorella)  But how about the rest of
the products like Asian grains,
chocolate, coffee?

1588
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:40,180
(Fiorella)  It's another company?

1589
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:41,700
(Fiorella)  Another name?

1590
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:42,500
(Fiorella)  It could be.

1591
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,300
(Akim)  It could be.

1592
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:43,860
(Akim)  It could be.

1593
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:44,900
(Akim)  We are thinking about it.

1594
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:47,060
(Akim)  It could be even dry
products and so on.

1595
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:49,060
(Akim)  It could be another brand
as well.

1596
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:49,620
(Akim)  Yeah.

1597
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:54,420
(Akim)  Because at the beginning,
we were initially thinking about fruits
and vegetables, including

1598
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:55,540
(Akim)  exotic fruits.

1599
01:43:56,500 --> 01:44:01,460
(Akim)  But now that we do, we
have potentially access to dried
products.

1600
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:06,420
(Akim)  By the way, this is
something we're looking at also because
we have contact in Ivory Coast

1601
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,820
(Akim)  that was doing the same
thing with mangoes.

1602
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:11,780
(Akim)  And so, we didn't know
that you have that on the portfolio, but
that's fine.

1603
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:16,020
(Akim)  So, we may think about
doing another brand just for that also,
including coffee and chocolate.

1604
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:16,820
(Akim)  So, it depends.

1605
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:18,820
(Akim)  We are building the
structure here.

1606
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:22,180
(Akim)  The more brands we have,
the better the catalog will be,
basically.

1607
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,260
(Ysam)  And then we can sell it.

1608
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:28,260
(Ysam)  And what do you think
about that, Ferreira, about to put
different brands and not only

1609
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,780
(Ysam)  one brand for all our
products?

1610
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,380
(Ysam)  Is it better to scale?

1611
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:33,060
(Ysam)  Or what do you think?

1612
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,980
(Ysam)  Just to have your overview
of that.

1613
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,180
(Ysam)  What do you think?

1614
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:47,700
(Fiorella)  I think it's good because
one other brand from the group of fruits
from a determined

1615
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:48,660
(Fiorella)  area from Peru.

1616
01:44:49,620 --> 01:45:04,980
(Fiorella)  And as our company will be
located in Holland or in France as a
hub, I think it's very important

1617
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:13,460
(Fiorella)  to create another sister
brand for each market because we have
more than two, three, four

1618
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:14,340
(Fiorella)  customers.

1619
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:17,780
(Fiorella)  So, in this situation, we
cannot compete with each other.

1620
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:26,340
(Fiorella)  And also, we can check how
they can manage each brand and how they
get the profit, the

1621
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,020
(Fiorella)  best for each brand.

1622
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:37,540
(Fiorella)  I have an experience with
the Chinese company that imports from
Peru and they told me, I

1623
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:49,940
(Fiorella)  said, I mean, Manuelita,
oh no, another name, Tiger, Panda, and
Spring.

1624
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,580
(Fiorella)  So, there are three
brands.

1625
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:59,140
(Fiorella)  For these three brands, I
prefer Panda and Tiger because they are
a very good quality,

1626
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:01,220
(Fiorella)  the size, the taste, and I
prefer this.

1627
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:14,820
(Fiorella)  So, if we gave the same
brands to all of our customers, we
cannot scale and we cannot

1628
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:22,020
(Fiorella)  difference how is the
improvement from them or how is the work
from each other or each

1629
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,180
(Fiorella)  one for each brand.

1630
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:34,740
(Fiorella)  And also, we cannot try to
compete each other with same brands.

1631
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:37,540
(Fiorella)  So, it's very important to
create or to…

1632
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,260
(Fiorella)  Different brands.

1633
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:39,380
(Ysam)  Okay, makes sense.

1634
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:41,620
(Fiorella)  Sister brands from the
mother brands.

1635
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:46,340
(Akim)  Actually, this is what we
were doing.

1636
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:49,140
(Akim)  So, we are on the right
track.

1637
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:51,780
(Akim)  But I think we were
thinking about three brands.

1638
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:53,300
(Akim)  Actually, no, more.

1639
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:57,860
(Akim)  But now that we have seen
your catalog, we'll be adding more
brands and see what we can

1640
01:46:58,980 --> 01:46:59,540
(Akim)  add to that.

1641
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:01,060
(Akim)  But we're building that
step by step.

1642
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,820
(Akim)  It's going to be very
quick.

1643
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:06,980
(Akim)  We want to be quick and
fast and get basically to give you an
idea, we want to be on the

1644
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:10,260
(Akim)  market in September of
this year.

1645
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:10,740
(Akim)  Very quick.

1646
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:14,500
(Fiorella)  But the idea is not to
have a lot of brands.

1647
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:18,260
(Akim)  No, no, no, no, a few
ones, but quality ones.

1648
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,100
(Fiorella)  Ah, yes.

1649
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:28,340
(Fiorella)  Top brands for top
products and for category one, maybe,
and the rest are commercial brands

1650
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:30,020
(Fiorella)  from the rest of the
customers.

1651
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:31,220
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1652
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:37,620
(Fiorella)  This is the firm that we
manage in Barayot, the company that I
worked four years ago.

1653
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:47,460
(Fiorella)  I create three brands,
main brands from all the markets, from
United States and

1654
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:55,220
(Fiorella)  Europe, and also Mexico,
and the rest, two or three brands as a
regular, as a commercial

1655
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:58,260
(Fiorella)  brand to give to the
regular customers.

1656
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,260
(Akim)  Yeah, makes sense.

1657
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:03,860
(Akim)  Then I have one question
for you, Fiorella.

1658
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:08,180
(Akim)  Do you have contacts in,
you mentioned Mexico, that's a good
point, but do you have contacts

1659
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:10,660
(Akim)  in Costa Rica and Mexico
also?

1660
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:14,980
(Akim)  Because at the end of the
day, we, of course, we target Peru, but
we want also to have,

1661
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:17,540
(Akim)  let's say, pineapples from
Costa Rica.

1662
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:20,100
(Akim)  We have to, we want to
have products from Mexico.

1663
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:25,300
(Akim)  Do you have contacts over
there or, I mean, local representation
or producers over there

1664
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:25,620
(Akim)  also?

1665
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:33,460
(Fiorella)  I have a good friend in
Mexico and he told me two days ago, he
have a booth, a company

1666
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:41,460
(Fiorella)  that import around the
world for grapes, mainly from Peru
grapes, and from the rest of the

1667
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:43,300
(Fiorella)  world, another kind of
fruits.

1668
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:50,980
(Fiorella)  And they told me, and
Mexico is now producing seedless grapes,
the better quality from United

1669
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:52,660
(Fiorella)  States and from Peru.

1670
01:48:52,660 --> 01:49:01,540
(Fiorella)  And the price of the, of
this case of grapes is around $55.

1671
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:04,900
(Akim)  Okay.

1672
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:06,980
(Fiorella)  Can you imagine?

1673
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:11,860
(Fiorella)  $55 for one case of, one
box of grapes?

1674
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:12,660
(Akim)  Oh, okay.

1675
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:17,940
(Ysam)  And compare to the market
usually is what, what is the big
difference?

1676
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:23,380
(Ysam)  Just to, because I can see
the, what is the real price are usually
between $55.

1677
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:26,340
(Ysam)  What is usually the gap?

1678
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:32,020
(Fiorella)  The common price in United
States from grapes, if it is seedless,
white seedless, it's around

1679
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:35,140
(Fiorella)  20, 25, 28.

1680
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:39,300
(Fiorella)  In the, in the good
market, 28.

1681
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:49,700
(Fiorella)  Now, they are paying in
Mexico from, from their own fruit,
Mexican fruit, $55.

1682
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:52,340
(Akim)  Why has it increased like
this?

1683
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:55,700
(Fiorella)  The quality, the size, the
taste.

1684
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:56,660
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1685
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:58,260
Okay.

1686
01:49:59,140 --> 01:49:59,460
And if...

1687
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:03,060
(Fiorella)  Uva Mexicana, $55 case.

1688
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:03,860
(Fiorella)  Yes.

1689
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:05,860
(Akim)  Okay.

1690
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:06,420
(Akim)  Okay.

1691
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,300
(Akim)  Interesting.

1692
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:11,140
(Akim)  And if you want, for
instance, to have pineapples from Costa
Rica,

1693
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:13,300
(Akim)  is it something you can
provide also?

1694
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:17,060
(Ysam)  Bahia.

1695
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:23,300
(Fiorella)  I don't know, I don't know
companies in Costa Rica, but I have some
friends.

1696
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:27,860
(Fiorella)  I can try to, to get the
contact from the importers.

1697
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:33,220
(Fiorella)  Or maybe I can do a
intelligence market and try to contact.

1698
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:35,620
(Akim)  We can do that.

1699
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:36,180
(Akim)  We can do that.

1700
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:37,780
(Akim)  No, that's not a problem.

1701
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:38,980
(Akim)  You're right.

1702
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:39,540
(Akim)  We're right.

1703
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:44,820
(Akim)  So we can, we can
actually, we, we are working in the
intelligence area, the three of us.

1704
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:45,780
(Akim)  So that's not an issue.

1705
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:46,580
(Akim)  We can do that.

1706
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:47,140
(Akim)  Okay.

1707
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:48,180
(Fiorella)  Like a CSI.

1708
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:49,460
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1709
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:51,540
(Akim)  It's not an issue.

1710
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:51,780
(Akim)  Okay.

1711
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:53,060
(Akim)  Sounds good.

1712
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:53,540
(Akim)  Sounds good.

1713
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,220
Good.

1714
01:50:55,220 --> 01:51:00,820
(Akim)  Let me check one thing
because you mentioned Mexico, but in
Mexico, there is...

1715
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,140
(Christophe)  Let me check one thing.

1716
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:12,100
(Fiorella)  And also I have a friend
from Egypt and they were from Egypt,
citrus.

1717
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:15,620
(Ysam)  Nice.

1718
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:16,020
(Ysam)  Okay.

1719
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:18,020
(Fiorella)  Tangerines, tangerines.

1720
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:19,380
(Fiorella)  Yes, citrus.

1721
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:24,260
(Fiorella)  And also South Africa,
apples.

1722
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:27,220
(Fiorella)  I have a one contact in
South Africa and one contact in Egypt.

1723
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:32,980
(Fiorella)  For apples and citrus.

1724
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:37,940
(Akim)  In Egypt, it's for citrus.

1725
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:38,260
(Akim)  Okay.

1726
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:39,940
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1727
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:40,820
(Akim)  Okay.

1728
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:47,780
(Akim)  Because in Egypt,
basically the most important fruits are
citrus, grapes, potatoes, and frozen

1729
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:48,260
(Akim)  berries.

1730
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:52,740
(Fiorella)  No, I have some, I have a
friend from that.

1731
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:54,660
(Fiorella)  She sell citrus.

1732
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:55,860
(Akim)  Okay.

1733
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:56,180
(Akim)  Okay.

1734
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:56,740
(Akim)  Interesting.

1735
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:58,100
(Akim)  Okay.

1736
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,700
(Akim)  We can, we can manage
that.

1737
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:04,740
(Akim)  And we have contacts also
in Egypt for tomatoes because Egypt is a
big producer of tomatoes

1738
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:05,060
(Akim)  as well.

1739
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:07,940
(Akim)  Okay.

1740
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:09,060
(Akim)  Makes sense.

1741
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:12,900
(Akim)  So as you can imagine, we
will be sourcing different countries,
but we start with Peru.

1742
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:17,060
(Akim)  Peru is really the country
where we focused at the beginning, but
then we will expand

1743
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:22,900
(Akim)  to Costa Rica, Mexico,
France, of course, Spain, Morocco,
Egypt.

1744
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:27,380
(Akim)  We have contacts also
established in Filipina and so on.

1745
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:33,060
(Akim)  So we want to cover the
Ivory Coast, I forgot, in Africa, in
Senegal, also through ISAM.

1746
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:38,660
(Akim)  So we want to cover
different countries from the production
standpoint and also from the

1747
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:39,700
(Akim)  construction standpoint.

1748
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:41,940
(Akim)  You see, and then we do
the matching like this.

1749
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:43,060
(Akim)  Okay.

1750
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:44,900
(Akim)  And the company will be in
Rotterdam.

1751
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:47,140
(Fiorella)  Oh, okay.

1752
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:47,300
(Ysam)  Yeah.

1753
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:53,860
(Ysam)  The goal is for our
customer is to always provide them
something, you know, of quality,

1754
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:54,500
(Ysam)  of course.

1755
01:52:55,460 --> 01:53:01,780
(Ysam)  We know for Peru, we can
provide the quantity, volume, and the
quality, but we are projecting

1756
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:07,300
(Ysam)  also to be ready in any
case to, we can provide from any country
in the world to provide the

1757
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:09,060
(Ysam)  best products, you know.

1758
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:14,420
(Akim)  And then one quick
question, regarding the logistics from
Peru, are you working with

1759
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:17,380
(Akim)  freight companies like
Turkish Airlines or something like this?

1760
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:18,660
(Akim)  What is the logistics
there?

1761
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:25,060
(Akim)  If you sell that by air,
let's say mangoes by air, how do you
work?

1762
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:28,260
(Akim)  I mean, is it going to the
airport?

1763
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,300
(Akim)  And then how does that
work?

1764
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:32,180
(Fiorella)  Yes.

1765
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:35,300
(Fiorella)  It depends of the company
that export of the packing house.

1766
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:37,540
(Fiorella)  We move the fruit to the
callao.

1767
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:38,820
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1768
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:47,300
(Fiorella)  There's only one airport,
international airport that they use the-

1769
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:49,540
(Ysam)  Callao in Lima?

1770
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:51,220
(Ysam)  Oh, sorry, Lima region.

1771
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:51,940
(Fiorella)  Callao in Lima.

1772
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,860
(Fiorella)  International airport is
the same.

1773
01:53:53,860 --> 01:54:06,020
(Fiorella)  So all the fruit that is
by air need to arrive to Callao, Jorge
Chavez.

1774
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:09,140
(Fiorella)  And then pass all the
protocol.

1775
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:09,860
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1776
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:16,820
(Fiorella)  And I know that it's
better for the export to consider five
skid as minimum.

1777
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:21,620
(Fiorella)  If they ship less, the
price is high.

1778
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,500
(Fiorella)  The minimum is five skids
or more.

1779
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,700
(Fiorella)  Five, ten-

1780
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:26,580
(Ysam)  Five pallets.

1781
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:28,020
(Ysam)  When you mean skid, it's
pallet, huh?

1782
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:28,820
(Fiorella)  Skid, yes.

1783
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,300
(Fiorella)  It's a pallet, but by air.

1784
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:37,700
(Fiorella)  Because the measure is
different than the pallets for the sea.

1785
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,060
(Ysam)  Okay.

1786
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:40,180
(Ysam)  And just a question about
that.

1787
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:42,740
(Ysam)  Just what do you think of
what she's devising?

1788
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:46,420
(Ysam)  You know that what she's
doing, Analucia, she's exporting from-

1789
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:49,780
(Ysam)  Because the one who is
from Pura, she's exporting from Ecuador.

1790
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:54,100
(Ysam)  She put the ship to
Ecuador and then to Ecuador to the other
end.

1791
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,220
(Ysam)  What do you think about
that?

1792
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:58,980
(Ysam)  Is it more cost or more
interesting or what's the complication?

1793
01:54:58,980 --> 01:54:59,460
(Ysam)  What do you think?

1794
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:02,420
(Fiorella)  I think it's due to the
cost.

1795
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:04,900
(Fiorella)  The cost and the time,
maybe.

1796
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:11,380
(Fiorella)  Because I listened that
from Ecuador, they don't pay some taxes.

1797
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:12,520
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1798
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:16,100
(Fiorella)  And they avoid that cost.

1799
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:25,540
(Fiorella)  But now, the politic
situation and economic situation in
Ecuador is not good.

1800
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:26,040
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1801
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:33,640
(Fiorella)  I don't know if it's a
good idea to try to move forward the
fruit from Ecuador

1802
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:36,360
(Fiorella)  and then from the final
issue.

1803
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:37,720
(Ysam)  Okay, all right.

1804
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:45,640
(Fiorella)  And I know more than three
international forwarders that manage

1805
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,960
(Fiorella)  and they have experience
in fresh fruit.

1806
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:51,320
(Fiorella)  So, we don't have problems
in this case.

1807
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:55,400
(Fiorella)  And also, if we negotiate
directly for the export,

1808
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:07,160
(Fiorella)  they will pay the freight
or they can negotiate for us the best
price

1809
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,440
(Fiorella)  because they manage
volume.

1810
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:10,440
(Fiorella)  So, it's better for us to-

1811
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:14,280
(Fiorella)  They negotiate for us
instead of we negotiate directly

1812
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:17,080
(Fiorella)  because we are starting
our operation.

1813
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:19,800
(Fiorella)  Okay, makes sense.

1814
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,560
(Fiorella)  The condition is totally
different.

1815
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:25,720
(Fiorella)  The payment terms and also
the price.

1816
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:28,600
(Fiorella)  Okay, makes sense.

1817
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:33,400
(Fiorella)  But I think in a medium or
a short time,

1818
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:41,320
(Fiorella)  I think the best way to do
this business is to establish a sucursal
here in Peru.

1819
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:42,120
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1820
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:47,000
(Fiorella)  The export directly to our
main office, no?

1821
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:49,080
(Fiorella)  Headquartered to
Rotterdam.

1822
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:51,180
(Akim)  Okay.

1823
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:57,080
(Fiorella)  Because we can manage and
take care of all the operation, all the
documents

1824
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:02,040
(Fiorella)  and get the duty of
drawback.

1825
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:03,080
(Fiorella)  That is 3%.

1826
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:07,720
(Fiorella)  And also, there are
another benefit that is

1827
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:15,320
(Fiorella)  it reimburses the taxes
that we pay.

1828
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:20,760
(Fiorella)  That is 18%.

1829
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:23,560
(Fiorella)  This is the taxes that
like an IVA.

1830
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,560
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1831
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,160
(Fiorella)  Here is 18%.

1832
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:31,400
(Fiorella)  So, there are two benefits
if you are an exporter.

1833
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:35,960
(Fiorella)  Return or reimburse the
drawback,

1834
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:38,920
(Fiorella)  the duty and the IGB.

1835
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:41,080
(Fiorella)  That is 18%.

1836
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:42,600
(Fiorella)  Devolución del IGB and
drawback.

1837
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:45,000
(Fiorella)  Those benefits.

1838
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:47,480
(Akim)  Okay, we'll be thinking
about it.

1839
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:50,440
(Akim)  And you have your company
over there or not at all?

1840
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:52,120
(Akim)  Do you have a company on
your name?

1841
01:57:54,280 --> 01:58:00,280
(Fiorella)  Yeah, I have a company
with my name because I am one of the
partners.

1842
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:01,080
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1843
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:07,800
(Fiorella)  During the pandemic, my
partner passed away.

1844
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,240
(Fiorella)  Oh, really?

1845
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:09,740
(Akim)  Wow.

1846
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:13,960
(Fiorella)  Yeah, because we started
the business of the avocados.

1847
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,360
(Fiorella)  We export avocados to
Europe.

1848
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:18,540
(Fiorella)  Thank you.

1849
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,400
(Fiorella)  You know the company, Fair
Connection?

1850
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:23,240
(Akim)  Fair Connection?

1851
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:24,300
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1852
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:25,520
(Fiorella)  Wow.

1853
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:34,060
(Fiorella)  Paul is a friend and he
gave me the pre-advanced season

1854
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:36,860
(Fiorella)  and a lot of things just
to start the business.

1855
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:37,500
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1856
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:40,300
(Fiorella)  Because he knows me more
than 10 years.

1857
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:40,800
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1858
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:43,340
(Fiorella)  But when—

1859
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:46,620
(Akim)  Paul is a French guy or
what?

1860
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:48,380
(Fiorella)  A French guy.

1861
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:51,260
(Fiorella)  He's a manager from the
Fair Connection company

1862
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,700
(Fiorella)  that imports fresh fruits
around the world.

1863
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:56,060
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1864
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:59,500
(Fiorella)  And they have an office in
Barenrech.

1865
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:00,000
(Fiorella)  Barenrech.

1866
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:06,060
(Akim)  And this guy passed away
or he's another guy?

1867
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:06,860
(Fiorella)  No, no, no.

1868
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:09,100
(Fiorella)  The other guy, the
Peruvian partner.

1869
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:09,980
(Akim)  My Peruvian partner.

1870
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:11,100
(Akim)  Your Peruvian partner.

1871
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:11,660
(Akim)  Okay.

1872
01:59:11,660 --> 01:59:17,340
(Fiorella)  And we need to stop
because this is the man in the fruit
inspection,

1873
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:22,620
(Fiorella)  the fruit contact to the
suppliers, the packing house.

1874
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:23,120
(Fiorella)  No.

1875
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:27,980
(Fiorella)  And he passed away so we
put in standby our company.

1876
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:29,020
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1877
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:35,660
(Fiorella)  Now I have my own company
as only one person.

1878
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:36,220
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1879
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:40,700
(Fiorella)  And also I have another
company with a partner.

1880
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:43,900
(Fiorella)  But this company is for
other service.

1881
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:44,860
(Fiorella)  He's here in Peru.

1882
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:45,360
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1883
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:45,940
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

1884
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:55,360
(Fiorella)  Maybe we can modify it or
put in an amendment in this kind of
company

1885
01:59:56,400 --> 02:00:00,400
(Fiorella)  and we export directly to
the headquarter.

1886
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,360
(Fiorella)  I think, I don't know.

1887
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:01,840
(Akim)  Yeah.

1888
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,400
(Akim)  Because the idea again is
to keep it simple.

1889
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:07,600
(Akim)  If you have an existing
basis of companies that we can use,

1890
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,120
(Akim)  that would be simpler for
us.

1891
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:12,800
(Akim)  Because let's say we need
one or two months to create just a
company in Peru.

1892
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,920
(Akim)  We don't have time.

1893
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,320
(Akim)  We want to be on the
market as soon as possible.

1894
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,320
(Akim)  But Rotterdam will be
launched pretty soon.

1895
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,640
(Akim)  So it's not an issue.

1896
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:25,520
(Akim)  But if you have your own
company or if you found a company that
we can amend,

1897
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:26,720
(Akim)  that would be perfect like
that.

1898
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,960
(Akim)  We can start transacting
as soon as possible.

1899
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:32,800
(Akim)  And using the Peruvian
benefits of having a company over there.

1900
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,920
(Akim)  Mm-hmm.

1901
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:35,520
(Akim)  That is what I want to
say.

1902
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:40,000
(Ysam)  And also, Fiora, when you
create a company, especially for that
market,

1903
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,520
(Ysam)  when you create a company
in Peru,

1904
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:44,640
(Ysam)  you have like one or two
or three years when you have a lot of
control

1905
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,080
(Ysam)  because you're a new
company, no?

1906
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,280
(Ysam)  I think it's something
like that, no?

1907
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:48,880
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

1908
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,680
(Fiorella)  I have my company, my own
company as a person.

1909
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,640
(Ysam)  So it's for...

1910
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:54,080
(Ysam)  You are already for many
years.

1911
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,040
(Ysam)  So it's already the...

1912
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:58,800
(Fiorella)  Maybe we can export with
this.

1913
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:00,100
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1914
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:01,280
(Akim)  Have a look.

1915
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,080
(Akim)  If you have your own
company, we can use that one.

1916
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:04,880
(Akim)  It's even better.

1917
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:05,940
(Akim)  Yeah.

1918
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,840
(Fiorella)  I have my own company.

1919
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,160
(Fiorella)  I am only one partner.

1920
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:11,540
(Akim)  That's fine.

1921
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,120
(Akim)  You are not alone anymore.

1922
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:17,440
(Akim)  We are here and we have a
lot of connections.

1923
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:18,320
(Akim)  You will see in the
future.

1924
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:21,760
(Akim)  But we have a lot of
connections in Europe and a lot of
countries.

1925
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:22,320
(Akim)  But you'll see.

1926
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:25,520
(Akim)  That's why we reach out to
you because we have connections.

1927
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:35,200
(Fiorella)  Let me check if we can
export as a personal company

1928
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:38,080
(Fiorella)  because I don't know if
there are an amount that we...

1929
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,920
(Fiorella)  If we accept the amount,
we need to move to another category.

1930
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:42,880
(Fiorella)  I don't know.

1931
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,880
(Fiorella)  Let me check with the
accountant.

1932
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:50,160
(Fiorella)  And if I can do, I don't
have...

1933
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:51,600
(Fiorella)  I can.

1934
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:52,080
(Akim)  Have a look.

1935
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:52,560
(Akim)  Have a look.

1936
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:53,280
(Akim)  Take your time.

1937
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:53,760
(Akim)  Have a look.

1938
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:56,080
(Akim)  You are a business partner
now with us.

1939
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:57,760
(Akim)  So have a look and let us
know.

1940
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,260
(Akim)  Okay?

1941
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,020
(Akim)  Cool.

1942
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:03,760
(Akim)  I think we're good.

1943
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:04,880
(Akim)  Good to go.

1944
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:05,840
(Akim)  Anything else, anyone?

1945
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:09,040
(Ysam)  For me, it's fine.

1946
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:11,840
(Ysam)  I think we re-review
everything.

1947
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:13,840
(Akim)  Christophe?

1948
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:14,800
(Christophe)  Yeah, I'm fine too.

1949
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,280
(Christophe)  Learning a lot of new
stuff.

1950
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:18,160
(Christophe)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1951
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:21,280
(Akim)  And Fiorella, we'll be
preparing a phone for you.

1952
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:21,600
(Akim)  Okay?

1953
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,560
(Akim)  You have to give us...

1954
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,520
(Akim)  Once we work together and
so on, we'll give us...

1955
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:26,960
(Akim)  We'll send you a phone.

1956
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,400
(Akim)  You have to give us your
address.

1957
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:29,440
(Akim)  We'll send it to you.

1958
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:32,320
(Akim)  A phone where you could
have your email address, everything on
it.

1959
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:34,180
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1960
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:41,460
(Fiorella)  It will be better if you
can send me an email with your proposal
about the...

1961
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:43,220
(Fiorella)  How we can work together.

1962
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:46,100
(Fiorella)  I don't know if a partner.

1963
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:47,380
(Fiorella)  Let me know.

1964
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:52,260
(Fiorella)  Because Peru has a good
and big potential.

1965
02:02:52,260 --> 02:03:01,780
(Fiorella)  And also my background and
my experience in Fresh, Dry, and IQF.

1966
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:05,860
(Fiorella)  Because I have experience
in IQF.

1967
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:08,020
(Akim)  What was that IQF?

1968
02:03:08,020 --> 02:03:08,520
(Akim)  Sorry.

1969
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:10,100
(Fiorella)  Frozen.

1970
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:10,740
(Akim)  Ah, frozen.

1971
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:11,240
(Akim)  Okay.

1972
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:15,860
(Fiorella)  I have experience in
frozen fruits, managing avocados, mango,
frozen.

1973
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:18,980
(Ysam)  Just one question, talking
about frozen.

1974
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:19,460
(Ysam)  What about...

1975
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:23,140
(Ysam)  Do you know Peru export
the frozen meat or no?

1976
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,780
(Ysam)  Meat, chicken, beef.

1977
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:27,300
(Ysam)  Ah, yeah.

1978
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:28,100
(Ysam)  Good question.

1979
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:31,860
(Fiorella)  No, it's from Brazil and
Argentina.

1980
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:33,140
(Ysam)  Argentina, okay.

1981
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:36,020
(Fiorella)  Those are the best in
those products.

1982
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:38,260
(Fiorella)  Peru exports seafoods.

1983
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:39,880
(Fiorella)  Seafood?

1984
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:40,380
(Fiorella)  Yes.

1985
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:41,720
(Akim)  Frozen?

1986
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:43,640
(Fiorella)  Frozen.

1987
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:45,240
(Fiorella)  Okay.

1988
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:49,860
(Fiorella)  And I have one company
that they can export directly seafoods.

1989
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:51,160
(Ysam)  Really?

1990
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:52,100
(Ysam)  With packaging and
everything?

1991
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:54,100
(Ysam)  I mean, with you.

1992
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:54,740
(Ysam)  Okay, nice.

1993
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:56,740
(Akim)  You have the website?

1994
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:58,500
(Akim)  You know what they do
already or not?

1995
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,000
(Fiorella)  No.

1996
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:02,420
(Akim)  Have a look.

1997
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:04,260
(Akim)  Next time like that, we
can review that.

1998
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:06,340
(Akim)  That's very interesting.

1999
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:07,300
(Akim)  Yeah, seafood.

2000
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:12,740
(Fiorella)  They produce shrimps,
scallops maybe?

2001
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:36,100
(Fiorella)  Seafood, giant squid,
canned anchovies, frozen shrimps.

2002
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:49,220
(Fiorella)  And also, I know another
company that they can provide us
Brazilian nuts and artichokes,

2003
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:52,580
(Fiorella)  but canned, not fresh.

2004
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:53,960
(Fiorella)  Not fresh.

2005
02:04:54,900 --> 02:05:00,260
(Fiorella)  Artichokes, hearts, and
quarters in presentation from six per
three kilograms.

2006
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:06,020
(Fiorella)  It's like an A10 canned.

2007
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:07,380
(Fiorella)  Also, yes.

2008
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:17,780
(Fiorella)  And frozen mango,
avocados, and also blueberries and
artichokes.

2009
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:22,980
(Ysam)  And you said artichokes
for earth only.

2010
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:23,460
(Ysam)  It's nice.

2011
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:25,380
(Ysam)  It's interesting for the
hotels and this.

2012
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:28,180
(Ysam)  Yeah, artichokes, okay.

2013
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:28,820
(Fiorella)  But canned.

2014
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:30,820
(Ysam)  What do you mean by
canned?

2015
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:32,660
(Fiorella)  Artichokes.

2016
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:34,020
(Akim)  Artichokes, okay.

2017
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:38,020
(Fiorella)  Artichokes canned in cans
or in jars?

2018
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:39,060
(Ysam)  Ah, okay.

2019
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:39,860
(Ysam)  Okay, I understand, in
box.

2020
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:40,500
(Ysam)  Okay.

2021
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:41,060
(Ysam)  Not fresh.

2022
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:42,020
(Ysam)  Not fresh.

2023
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:42,660
(Ysam)  Okay, no problem.

2024
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:43,160
(Ysam)  Okay.

2025
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:44,260
(Ysam)  This can be interesting.

2026
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:44,760
(Ysam)  Okay.

2027
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:48,340
(Ysam)  It's good to have all the
views.

2028
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:48,840
(Ysam)  Okay.

2029
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:50,820
(Akim)  And then just a quick
question.

2030
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:56,020
(Akim)  When you were, before,
with your business partner that passed
away, you were going to

2031
02:05:56,020 --> 02:06:00,740
(Akim)  launch a company on
avocado, but is it like us avocado that
you are going to export?

2032
02:06:03,620 --> 02:06:04,900
(Akim)  What are you going to
export?

2033
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:05,780
(Akim)  Avocado only?

2034
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:07,780
(Fiorella)  Only avocado.

2035
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:09,780
(Akim)  For which market?

2036
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:11,540
(Akim)  Which countries?

2037
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:13,480
(Fiorella)  Holland.

2038
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:15,620
(Fiorella)  Rotterdam.

2039
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:16,340
(Akim)  Rotterdam also?

2040
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:17,060
(Akim)  Rotterdam.

2041
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:18,020
(Akim)  Okay, okay, cool.

2042
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:23,620
(Fiorella)  And then it stopped
because my partner passed away and
didn't do anything.

2043
02:06:25,940 --> 02:06:26,440
(Akim)  Okay.

2044
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:28,980
(Akim)  That's interesting.

2045
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:29,620
(Akim)  Okay.

2046
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:32,900
(Akim)  And you see a huge demand
for avocados these days?

2047
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:33,940
(Akim)  I mean, it's like mangoes.

2048
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:37,140
(Akim)  People are asking for
mangoes, but people are also asking for
avocados, right?

2049
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:41,060
(Akim)  I mean, countries are
asking for that.

2050
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:42,820
(Akim)  It's a huge market.

2051
02:06:43,460 --> 02:06:43,960
(Fiorella)  Yes.

2052
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:49,480
(Akim)  And based on your
experience, what is the products that
have the highest margin?

2053
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:51,000
(Akim)  Is it mangoes or avocados?

2054
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:55,480
(Fiorella)  Blueberries.

2055
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:56,360
(Fiorella)  Blueberries?

2056
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:56,860
(Fiorella)  Really?

2057
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:58,620
(Fiorella)  Yes.

2058
02:06:59,320 --> 02:06:59,820
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2059
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:10,840
(Fiorella)  Because all of the
countries from Asia, from Europe, and
from United States are looking

2060
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,280
(Fiorella)  for blueberries.

2061
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:18,760
(Fiorella)  I have customers in United
States and they have a company in United
States that exports

2062
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:19,880
(Fiorella)  around the world.

2063
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:21,720
(Fiorella)  And he asked me about
blueberries.

2064
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:23,640
(Fiorella)  Do you have blueberries?

2065
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:27,480
(Fiorella)  I need a forecast, a
program for one supermarket.

2066
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,020
(Fiorella)  So.

2067
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:31,020
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2068
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:39,960
(Fiorella)  Maybe if we invest here in
one farm to produce blueberries, it's
like a lottery.

2069
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:46,760
(Fiorella)  Well, the prices are not
the same as the last five years ago
because it's totally different.

2070
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,600
(Fiorella)  The demand of blueberries
is continuing.

2071
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:56,840
(Fiorella)  And also there are some
projects here in Peru to produce organic
blueberries, organic avocados,

2072
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:59,400
(Fiorella)  but in a few quantity.

2073
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:04,120
(Fiorella)  And also there are some
projects to produce a strawberry.

2074
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:07,080
(Fiorella)  How was it?

2075
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:07,800
(Fiorella)  Strawberries?

2076
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:08,440
(Fiorella)  No, strawberries.

2077
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:09,000
(Fiorella)  Espresso.

2078
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:11,640
(Akim)  Blueberries, espresso,
yeah.

2079
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,140
(Fiorella)  Cherries.

2080
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:14,600
(Fiorella)  Cherries, cherries,
cherries, cherries.

2081
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:15,640
(Ysam)  Are you going for
cherries?

2082
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:19,960
(Fiorella)  There are one project that
they company that it's.

2083
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:22,940
(Ysam)  Okay.

2084
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,280
(Ysam)  And because, just a
question.

2085
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:28,680
(Ysam)  We got the product now
from Peru.

2086
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:31,160
(Ysam)  We got from Peru, I saw it
in the market yesterday.

2087
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:32,760
(Ysam)  It's Granada?

2088
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:33,400
(Ysam)  Palm Granada?

2089
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:34,520
(Ysam)  How you say it in Spanish?

2090
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:35,160
(Ysam)  Granadilla.

2091
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:35,660
(Ysam)  Granada?

2092
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:37,320
(Ysam)  Granadilla, yes.

2093
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:38,520
(Ysam)  What about Granadilla?

2094
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,360
(Fiorella)  There are two different
fruits.

2095
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,960
(Fiorella)  One is Granada, that is
red.

2096
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:45,000
(Fiorella)  And the other one is
Granadilla.

2097
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,880
(Fiorella)  It's like a sweet passion
fruit.

2098
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,440
(Fiorella)  It's called a sweet
passion fruit.

2099
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,120
(Fiorella)  That is a tropical fruit
also.

2100
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:57,320
(Fiorella)  Granada is, this is
Granada.

2101
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:59,080
(Ysam)  Wait, it's Granadino, no?

2102
02:08:59,080 --> 02:08:59,580
(Ysam)  Granada?

2103
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:05,080
(Ysam)  Granada is the, you know,
when you open it, it's a lot of small
balls inside.

2104
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:06,840
(Ysam)  How you say in Spanish?

2105
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:10,120
(Fiorella)  A small balls into, this
is Granada.

2106
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:14,440
(Ysam)  Okay, just to don't mix
the-

2107
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,240
(Fiorella)  This is Granada.

2108
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:17,740
(Fiorella)  This.

2109
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:21,320
(Ysam)  Yes, this product is very
high demand on this product, yeah.

2110
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:23,560
(Ysam)  What about this product
from Peru?

2111
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:27,720
(Ysam)  This is, can it be volume
or different variety or what?

2112
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:29,320
(Ysam)  What is the status of this
product in Peru?

2113
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:33,160
(Fiorella)  We are not a big dealer in
this product, but we have.

2114
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:35,720
(Fiorella)  We have this product.

2115
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:38,680
(Fiorella)  There are some companies
that they produce at the north of Peru.

2116
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:40,360
(Fiorella)  And I can get.

2117
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:46,280
(Fiorella)  And the other one is
Granadilla.

2118
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:51,720
(Fiorella)  And this is another exotic
fruit that it's, we have protocol with
this fruit.

2119
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,160
(Fiorella)  And this is-

2120
02:09:53,160 --> 02:10:00,280
(Ysam)  Yes, this is the kind of
fresh, I mean, it's similar to a passion
fruit.

2121
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:01,560
(Ysam)  Like we call that in
French.

2122
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:04,600
(Ysam)  It's very, very nice,
yeah.

2123
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:08,440
(Fiorella)  The appearance is similar,
but the taste is very-

2124
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:09,560
(Ysam)  It's much more sweet.

2125
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:14,360
(Fiorella)  Yeah, it is sweet and the
passion fruit is sour.

2126
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:18,360
(Ysam)  Guys, if you can taste
this one, it's incredible.

2127
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:20,040
(Ysam)  It's, yeah, this fruit.

2128
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,120
(Fiorella)  It's very, very nice.

2129
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:23,480
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2130
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:24,280
(Fiorella)  Very delicious.

2131
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:26,760
(Fiorella)  It's one of the-

2132
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:29,160
(Akim)  What's the name of this
one?

2133
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:31,000
(Akim)  Granadilla.

2134
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,600
(Fiorella)  Granadilla, okay.

2135
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:34,200
(Fiorella)  Or sweet passion fruit.

2136
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,920
(Ysam)  Yeah, basically, sweet
passion fruit.

2137
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,120
(Ysam)  Basically, it's a sweet
passion fruit.

2138
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:43,480
(Fiorella)  And also, sweet passion
fruit is exported to Brazil.

2139
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:54,520
(Fiorella)  And there are one company
that is specialized in this fruit near
to Satipo.

2140
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:56,440
(Ysam)  Satipo, okay.

2141
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:58,360
(Fiorella)  Yeah, near to Satipo.

2142
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:03,000
(Fiorella)  And they produce in a
special area.

2143
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:13,960
(Fiorella)  And they have certificate,
but not as organic.

2144
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:15,320
(Fiorella)  It's a different
certificate.

2145
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:24,440
(Fiorella)  I think it's better for us
to try to investigate about these
products.

2146
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:27,800
(Fiorella)  Because there are not many
players in this business.

2147
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:33,880
(Fiorella)  For passion fruit and for
granada, so-so.

2148
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,040
(Fiorella)  And also blueberry.

2149
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:44,280
(Fiorella)  But for passion fruit,
sweet passion fruits, there are only one
or two producers.

2150
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:49,560
(Fiorella)  And there are a few
imports of this kind of products.

2151
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:50,840
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2152
02:11:50,840 --> 02:12:01,240
(Fiorella)  But if we try to impose or
we try to do the best strategy to
promote this product,

2153
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:02,920
(Fiorella)  I think we can do both
things.

2154
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:04,200
(Akim)  Okay.

2155
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:08,120
(Akim)  And you said blueberries,
we have the highest marketing on this
one, right?

2156
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:09,240
(Akim)  If we do that one.

2157
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:10,520
(Fiorella)  Blueberries, yes.

2158
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:14,200
(Akim)  I've put a document on the
chat if you want to have a look.

2159
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:14,760
(Akim)  You're right.

2160
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:17,640
(Christophe)  There is a big demand on
blueberries in different countries.

2161
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:21,480
(Christophe)  What does it mean in terms
of investment when you say,

2162
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:26,360
(Christophe)  if you invest in a
blueberry farm building dedicated to
that,

2163
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:28,760
(Christophe)  about how much are we
talking about exactly?

2164
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:31,560
(Fiorella)  It's expensive.

2165
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:32,680
(Fiorella)  It's not a low cost.

2166
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:37,080
(Fiorella)  I don't know the idea
because it depends on the quantity of
hectares.

2167
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:42,680
(Fiorella)  But it's not cheap.

2168
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:43,400
(Fiorella)  It's expensive.

2169
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:47,560
(Akim)  Do you think some
producers are okay to sell their land?

2170
02:12:49,880 --> 02:13:04,840
(Fiorella)  I know engineers that they
can help to establish the area for
blueberries.

2171
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:06,520
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2172
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:09,720
Just what is the difference between so
the granadilla and maracuja?

2173
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,760
(Ysam)  Maracuja is more acid?

2174
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:14,200
(Ysam)  Maracuja is passion fruit.

2175
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:15,480
Okay.

2176
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:16,040
So maracuja is...

2177
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:16,360
Okay.

2178
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:16,600
Okay.

2179
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:17,000
So it's fine.

2180
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:17,160
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2181
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:20,440
(Ysam)  Granadilla is sweet.

2182
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:20,680
(Ysam)  Okay.

2183
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:23,000
(Fiorella)  Passion fruit.

2184
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:23,240
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

2185
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:26,520
(Ysam)  Because usually in Europe,
they consume a lot of passion fruits.

2186
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,840
(Ysam)  Can we get volume of
maracuja?

2187
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:29,880
(Ysam)  It's possible?

2188
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:31,480
(Ysam)  Okay.

2189
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:31,560
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2190
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:31,640
(Ysam)  Okay.

2191
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:31,720
(Ysam)  Okay.

2192
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:31,800
(Ysam)  Okay.

2193
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:31,880
(Ysam)  Okay.

2194
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:31,960
(Ysam)  Okay.

2195
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:32,040
(Ysam)  Okay.

2196
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,120
(Ysam)  Okay.

2197
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:32,200
(Ysam)  Okay.

2198
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:32,280
(Ysam)  Okay.

2199
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:32,360
(Ysam)  Okay.

2200
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:32,440
(Ysam)  Okay.

2201
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:32,520
(Ysam)  Okay.

2202
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:32,600
(Ysam)  Okay.

2203
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:32,680
(Ysam)  Okay.

2204
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:32,760
(Ysam)  Okay.

2205
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:32,840
(Ysam)  Okay.

2206
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:32,920
(Ysam)  Okay.

2207
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:33,000
(Ysam)  Okay.

2208
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:33,080
(Ysam)  Okay.

2209
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:33,160
(Ysam)  Okay.

2210
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:33,240
(Ysam)  Okay.

2211
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:34,760
(Ysam)  It's possible?

2212
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:36,360
(Ysam)  Okay.

2213
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:39,880
(Ysam)  Passion fruit is what we
got, I think, Christophe and Akim.

2214
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:41,320
(Ysam)  Usually we got that in
France.

2215
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:43,480
(Ysam)  Acid, but it's acid.

2216
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:45,720
(Ysam)  Very classical.

2217
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:49,880
(Akim)  For blueberries, Fiorella,
we can see that there is a huge demand
in Asia

2218
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,040
(Akim)  and also in the Middle
East.

2219
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:54,440
(Akim)  You can see growth in Asia
and Middle East as well.

2220
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:59,800
(Fiorella)  Asia, Middle East, Europe,
United States.

2221
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:00,840
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2222
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:07,960
(Fiorella)  Because we have a window
that is the commercial season is
different from the United States

2223
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:09,560
(Fiorella)  because they produce.

2224
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:15,720
(Fiorella)  But we start the season
when they don't have product or they
don't have fruit.

2225
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:25,880
(Fiorella)  And also from China, the
most important thing is that if you sell
blueberries and if you sell

2226
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:38,120
(Fiorella)  table grapes, you can get
better price when the fruit arrives
before Chinese year.

2227
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:42,520
(Fiorella)  And for blueberries, it's
another special day.

2228
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:47,240
(Fiorella)  If you arrive before this,
you can get better price.

2229
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:56,520
(Fiorella)  And also, it's very
important, the caliber, because the
caliber and the product that they

2230
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:03,480
(Fiorella)  want in terms of
blueberries is a sweet blueberry, not
sour.

2231
02:15:04,280 --> 02:15:07,640
(Fiorella)  And the sizes are same as
grape.

2232
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:13,000
(Fiorella)  They prepare big calibers.

2233
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:22,840
(Fiorella)  And in blueberries, the
caliber is around 14 or 14 plus or 16
plus.

2234
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:25,980
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2235
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:28,860
(Akim)  Good.

2236
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:30,700
(Akim)  Good.

2237
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:34,920
(Akim)  So, as you have
understood, step by step, we'll be
structuring this business.

2238
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:41,960
(Akim)  But the idea is to get to
the highest quality products with the
highest margin and try to do

2239
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:45,800
(Akim)  some good transactions
between Peru and Europe.

2240
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:47,260
(Akim)  Okay.

2241
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:49,720
(Akim)  Any questions for us, for
Fiorella?

2242
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:50,920
(Akim)  Do you have any questions
for us?

2243
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:01,480
(Ysam)  No question for Fiorella?

2244
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:01,980
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2245
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:04,760
(Fiorella)  Now, do you have some
customers from Ginger?

2246
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:12,200
(Akim)  For Ginger, I think you
have something, no?

2247
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,680
(Ysam)  Yes, it depends.

2248
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:26,120
(Ysam)  I mean, for Ginger, it
could be interesting for us if we have a
farmer can provide a long-term

2249
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:27,160
(Ysam)  contract, for example.

2250
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:31,000
(Ysam)  Is it possible, for
example, to provide in the long term?

2251
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:34,040
(Ysam)  To have a program, like
you said, yeah.

2252
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:37,240
(Ysam)  That would be, I mean, can
we have a response, a clear response?

2253
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:43,160
(Ysam)  And by your experience, I
mean, a real exchange with them.

2254
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:44,920
(Ysam)  Because I mean, example
farm.

2255
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:48,520
(Ysam)  If you've got a contract
with one of the supermarkets or the
customer.

2256
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,040
(Ysam)  Like Carrefour, Auchan, or
whatever.

2257
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:50,600
(Ysam)  Yes.

2258
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:54,200
(Ysam)  What they will ask us,
they will say, okay, this product is
fine.

2259
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:59,080
(Ysam)  We will provide the
technical sheet.

2260
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:05,480
(Ysam)  But what they would ask
us, okay, we can make an agreement
together, but we have to

2261
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:09,880
(Ysam)  provide this every week in
the next four months without any...

2262
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:11,880
(Ysam)  Disruption.

2263
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:13,800
(Ysam)  Yeah, that's the most
important at the end.

2264
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:17,400
(Ysam)  So, I mean, the same
quality, the same package, you know?

2265
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:24,760
(Fiorella)  Yeah, because I have one
producer that export for more than five
years.

2266
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:35,560
(Fiorella)  And I work with him during
three years as a commercial manager, but
like an outsourcing

2267
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:38,040
(Fiorella)  or a trader.

2268
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:47,560
(Fiorella)  And I get a program from
two supermarkets from Russia.

2269
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:50,920
(Fiorella)  For the work, obviously.

2270
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:57,720
(Fiorella)  And we manage a program
around 10 containers, one container per
month.

2271
02:17:58,280 --> 02:18:07,800
(Fiorella)  This company produce five
containers during the month.

2272
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:10,140
(Fiorella)  No, no.

2273
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:13,080
(Fiorella)  Five containers during the
day, week.

2274
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:20,120
(Fiorella)  But if we have a program,
we can take two containers per week.

2275
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:26,280
(Fiorella)  And the caliber is around
80 grams plus.

2276
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:37,960
(Fiorella)  And if the supermarket
wants another caliber, like 100 grams
plus, we can do it.

2277
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:39,480
(Fiorella)  But the price is totally
different.

2278
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:47,960
(Fiorella)  As I mentioned before, the
prices from China and Brazil is
different from Peru.

2279
02:18:48,680 --> 02:19:02,680
(Fiorella)  I know that in China and
Brazil are managing the $14, $15 case
for 30.6 kilograms.

2280
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:10,760
(Fiorella)  Here in Peru, we are
managing $20 per case, the same
presentation.

2281
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:12,380
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2282
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:15,800
(Fiorella)  But also, it depends on
the customer.

2283
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:19,320
(Fiorella)  The quality is totally
different.

2284
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:25,400
(Fiorella)  The concentrate of ginger,
Peruvian ginger, is totally different.

2285
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:26,360
(Fiorella)  It's spicy.

2286
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:27,000
(Fiorella)  It's yellow.

2287
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:39,560
(Fiorella)  And if they produce or
they use for industrial, the proportion
that they use Chinese or Chinese

2288
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:42,280
(Fiorella)  ginger and Peruvian ginger
is totally different.

2289
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:49,160
(Fiorella)  Maybe in Chinese, they can
use, for example, one liter or one
kilogram or something.

2290
02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:54,920
(Fiorella)  They need 10 or 8
kilograms.

2291
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:57,000
(Fiorella)  And from Peru, one or two
kilograms no more.

2292
02:19:58,120 --> 02:19:59,240
(Fiorella)  This is a big difference.

2293
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:04,120
(Fiorella)  And the tasty, the flavor,
the spicy is totally different from
China.

2294
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:05,640
(Ysam)  Yeah, got it.

2295
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:08,200
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2296
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:12,360
(Fiorella)  So, this company have the
experience, have the product.

2297
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:14,440
(Fiorella)  They export right now.

2298
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:21,960
(Fiorella)  And they can provide a
program for one or two containers per
week.

2299
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:27,720
(Fiorella)  Also, we can do a mix
pallets for turmeric.

2300
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:31,160
(Fiorella)  Both are organic, so we
don't have problem.

2301
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:33,880
(Fiorella)  And they are located in
Pichanaki.

2302
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:35,960
(Akim)  Pichanaki, okay.

2303
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,560
(Akim)  Just a quick question,
Fiorella.

2304
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:39,800
(Akim)  Your own company, how long
is it?

2305
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:42,840
(Akim)  I mean, how old is your
company?

2306
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:45,960
(Akim)  Is it five years, 10 years
that you have on your name?

2307
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:51,800
(Fiorella)  Three years.

2308
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:54,120
(Fiorella)  Three years, maybe.

2309
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:55,080
(Akim)  Three years?

2310
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:58,200
(Akim)  Because you told me if
it's five years, we don't have control.

2311
02:20:58,200 --> 02:20:59,480
(Akim)  Is that correct or?

2312
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:01,240
(Ysam)  No, I think three years is
fine.

2313
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:05,080
(Ysam)  Because I mean, it's for
analogy, I was thinking about that.

2314
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:08,520
(Ysam)  She was telling me when
she starts, she got a lot of control in
the first second.

2315
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:12,520
(Ysam)  She has to pass by that
because that's this kind of regulation.

2316
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:15,800
(Ysam)  And it's a lot of time to
spend, you know.

2317
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:20,920
(Fiorella)  Do you refer for custom
controls or what though?

2318
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:22,200
(Ysam)  Yes, both.

2319
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:25,800
(Ysam)  I mean, cost of control,
also bank control, you know.

2320
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:29,160
(Ysam)  She's a new company.

2321
02:21:29,160 --> 02:21:33,640
(Ysam)  She was telling me that
she got a lot of control from
everywhere, from custom, of course.

2322
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:37,480
(Ysam)  From custom, but also in
the bank, you know, for tax.

2323
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:44,040
(Ysam)  But then she told me after
three years, she got, she was fine.

2324
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:47,400
(Fiorella)  For papers, no, because
all is formal.

2325
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:49,000
(Fiorella)  It's legal.

2326
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:57,160
(Fiorella)  Accordingly to the
shipments, if the company is not
continue shipping,

2327
02:21:58,120 --> 02:22:00,600
(Fiorella)  there are controls,
obviously.

2328
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:04,200
(Fiorella)  And if it's new, also more
controls.

2329
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:14,600
(Fiorella)  And if it's a company with
five, ten experience, they also have
controls.

2330
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:19,800
(Fiorella)  Not the same as a new, but
they have controls.

2331
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:21,260
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2332
02:22:22,220 --> 02:22:29,100
(Fiorella)  And we have experience in
this situation in export with papers,
with documents, with a

2333
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:31,420
(Fiorella)  lot of, so we don't have
problems.

2334
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:35,340
(Fiorella)  And also they open or scan
the container.

2335
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:36,220
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2336
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:45,500
(Fiorella)  In terms of fresh fruit,
they scan if they cannot find drugs or
something illegal, we

2337
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:46,300
(Fiorella)  don't have problems.

2338
02:22:46,780 --> 02:22:55,340
(Fiorella)  I remember when I started
my shipments as a new company, have
controls and they scan

2339
02:22:55,340 --> 02:23:00,940
(Fiorella)  or open according to the
products, if it's dried or fresh, if
it's fresh, scan, and if

2340
02:23:00,940 --> 02:23:08,060
(Fiorella)  it's dry, open the
container and check in if all of the
shipments, it's okay.

2341
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:09,120
(Fiorella)  It's okay.

2342
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:17,660
(Fiorella)  And if it's okay, do a
paper and sign and say, it's okay, no
problem, go ahead.

2343
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:18,800
(Fiorella)  No more.

2344
02:23:19,180 --> 02:23:26,860
(Akim)  And is it worth also,
Issam told me that, to pay for someone
to check also the production

2345
02:23:26,860 --> 02:23:28,300
(Akim)  before it goes into the
plane?

2346
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:30,060
(Akim)  Right, Issam?

2347
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:33,100
(Ysam)  Yes, because she was
taking someone for five minutes.

2348
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:33,740
(Ysam)  You see what I mean?

2349
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:35,020
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2350
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:39,740
(Ysam)  Even when the
phytosanitary certificate, you put
someone for the control before the

2351
02:23:39,740 --> 02:23:43,580
(Ysam)  production, before you go,
merchandise go, someone come check.

2352
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:48,700
(Ysam)  Usually we take company
like Veritas or SGS, but you can also
take someone, I mean, just

2353
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:51,100
(Ysam)  to have certificate before
the merchandise go.

2354
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:53,900
(Ysam)  Do you do that by yourself
or you know someone?

2355
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:59,820
(Fiorella)  Do you refer as a QC
origin control?

2356
02:24:00,780 --> 02:24:04,620
(Ysam)  Yes, I think it's DATEA,
to control the merchandise.

2357
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:13,020
(Fiorella)  I prefer to have one
person that they have experience in
those kinds of routes, because

2358
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:17,900
(Fiorella)  in this situation, we can
assure that the products that we are
buying or processing,

2359
02:24:17,900 --> 02:24:18,400
(Fiorella)  it's okay.

2360
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:25,900
(Fiorella)  And we can avoid troubles
or problems in destination when the
container arrive and you

2361
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:27,500
(Fiorella)  can find surprises.

2362
02:24:28,060 --> 02:24:28,560
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

2363
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:33,180
(Ysam)  But you got contacts for
that?

2364
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:37,180
(Fiorella)  Yeah, I have some contacts
of this country.

2365
02:24:39,100 --> 02:24:48,780
(Fiorella)  I prefer, because when I
work with a Chinese company, I travel
here in Peru and also China.

2366
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:59,260
(Fiorella)  I travel in Peru to Ica,
to Cañete, to Olmos, Trujillo, checking
how is the production,

2367
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:05,820
(Fiorella)  how is the fruit, if the
fruit is the taste is good, the bricks,
the color, everything.

2368
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:17,100
(Fiorella)  And then prepare or
negotiate how is the forecast for us,
one container per month, per week,

2369
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:25,980
(Fiorella)  the whole program, 10, 11
containers, and then go to the packing,
checking how is the

2370
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:33,980
(Fiorella)  process, checking how is
the, if the labeling is okay, if the
taste, and if it's needed,

2371
02:25:34,940 --> 02:25:48,780
(Fiorella)  I'm going with the QC
person to check exhaustly some cases of
the fruit during that.

2372
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:49,820
(Akim)  Some samples, okay.

2373
02:25:50,620 --> 02:25:51,260
(Akim)  Yes.

2374
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:53,980
(Akim)  And that QC person is
someone you pay for that, right?

2375
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:57,420
(Fiorella)  Yeah, but we have two
ways.

2376
02:25:58,380 --> 02:26:07,020
(Fiorella)  We can contract to the
person for the specific shipments or for
the whole program during a

2377
02:26:07,020 --> 02:26:16,140
(Fiorella)  month. We can pay for
during the day or during the trip, or we
can pay a salary for a month.

2378
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:19,020
(Akim)  Okay, I see what you mean.

2379
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:20,780
(Akim)  Over the season.

2380
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:25,980
(Akim)  Someone that could be
dedicated to that, just working for us,
and he does that on a regular

2381
02:26:26,060 --> 02:26:31,260
(Akim)  basis, and he covers all
the products that we're selling, he does
the QC control for us.

2382
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:36,780
(Fiorella)  And also they can check in
the control, not only in the packaging,
in the package process,

2383
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:48,060
(Fiorella)  in the packing house, they
can work for us since the farm, they can
check and inspect how is the,

2384
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:56,380
(Fiorella)  you know, if it's good,
it's not good, how they say, how they
can check,

2385
02:26:58,620 --> 02:27:00,620
(Fiorella)  from the farm to the
process.

2386
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:05,820
(Akim)  Got it. Okay, makes sense.

2387
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:08,220
(Akim)  Good, good, good.

2388
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:10,540
(Akim)  Anything else, anyone?

2389
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:13,260
(Akim)  Gustave, Fiorella, Issam?

2390
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:15,260
(Ysam)  No, it's fine.

2391
02:27:15,260 --> 02:27:21,340
(Ysam)  I think we have also a lot
to discuss then in the next discussion,
but yeah, it's a good start.

2392
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:23,660
(Akim)  Good start. Thank you,
Fiorella, for your time.

2393
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:30,140
(Akim)  Definitely, Gustave will
get back to you next week regarding the
tooling and so on.

2394
02:27:30,860 --> 02:27:34,940
(Akim)  Also, he will show you the
website if you have ideas and so on.

2395
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:38,460
(Akim)  And then we'll get back to
you, the four of us together, probably
next week,

2396
02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:44,220
(Akim)  also end of next week, to
review exactly what kind of products we
want to put in our catalog,

2397
02:27:44,780 --> 02:27:47,660
(Akim)  and what we can start, you
know, selling immediately.

2398
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:50,700
(Akim)  It could be ginger, it
could be whatever you have in stock.

2399
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:55,100
(Akim)  Okay, can you send us the
catalog, please, also, Fiorella, by
email,

2400
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:56,940
(Akim)  the different catalogs
that you have?

2401
02:27:56,940 --> 02:28:04,140
(Akim)  Dry, frozen, seafood,
vegetables, exotic fruits, fruits in
general, etc.

2402
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:06,700
(Akim)  All the catalogs that you
have like that, we can start compiling,

2403
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:09,020
(Akim)  collecting, you know, and
building an offering.

2404
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:10,380
(Akim)  That will be our target.

2405
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:14,460
(Akim)  No, because the idea at
the end of the day is to start having
programs.

2406
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:18,860
(Akim)  Let's say a program for
avocado, program for mango,

2407
02:28:18,860 --> 02:28:23,100
(Akim)  that will be, we have
contacts already at Carrefour and Osho
and so on,

2408
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:25,260
(Akim)  but that will be
presenting to those companies and say,

2409
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:29,420
(Akim)  hey, you want avocado for
the year, we have avocado for the year.

2410
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:31,820
(Akim)  You want mangoes, we have
mangoes for the year.

2411
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:35,100
(Akim)  You want blueberries, we
have blueberries for the year, you see?

2412
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:37,260
(Akim)  We need to start building
the offering, basically.

2413
02:28:37,660 --> 02:28:44,620
(Fiorella)  Also, I can provide the
web page that I created for my last
company.

2414
02:28:44,620 --> 02:28:46,620
(Fiorella)  Oh, yeah, yeah, if you
have that, yeah.

2415
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:49,740
(Ysam)  That will mix it with
the...

2416
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:50,860
(Ysam)  Yeah, definitely.

2417
02:28:50,860 --> 02:28:53,660
(Akim)  You can share it right now
on the chat.

2418
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:55,020
(Akim)  Let me check.

2419
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:57,980
(Akim)  There is a lot of info

2420
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:00,780
All together.

2421
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:05,100
(Fiorella)  Let me check what is the
website.

2422
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:06,140
(Fiorella)  What is the website?

2423
02:29:06,940 --> 02:29:07,660
(Fiorella)  I forgot it.

2424
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:12,940
(Akim)  And if you like to do
websites and so on, Christophe is the
expert.

2425
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:13,980
(Akim)  You can rely on him.

2426
02:29:30,220 --> 02:29:31,180
(Fiorella)  It's very beautiful.

2427
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:33,020
(Fiorella)  It's my creation.

2428
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:38,140
(Akim)  Okay, let's see, let's
see.

2429
02:29:38,140 --> 02:29:39,660
(Akim)  We like creative people.

2430
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:41,100
(Akim)  That's not a problem.

2431
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:43,500
(Akim)  That's why we were also
discussing...

2432
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:44,140
(Akim)  No, but that's true.

2433
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:46,860
(Akim)  We were discussing that
points two days ago all together.

2434
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:47,980
(Akim)  So, that's good.

2435
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:50,460
(Fiorella)  What is my web page?

2436
02:29:54,300 --> 02:29:55,180
(Akim)  You did it alone?

2437
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:58,320
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2438
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:02,860
(Akim)  So, you have a computer
skills?

2439
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:05,100
(Fiorella)  No, no, no, no.

2440
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:12,300
(Fiorella)  I only put in my ability
on create, my design, colors and all of
that.

2441
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:19,020
(Fiorella)  But in terms of web page
to create, to upload, maybe if it's...

2442
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:29,420
(Fiorella)  There are some formats
pre-established.

2443
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:34,380
(Fiorella)  And you can add
information and write.

2444
02:30:34,380 --> 02:30:38,140
(Fiorella)  This is the word
reference, yeah?

2445
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:40,540
(Fiorella)  Christophe, word
reference.

2446
02:30:40,540 --> 02:30:42,940
(Fiorella)  This is some formats.

2447
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:44,940
(Christophe)  Yes, there was many.

2448
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:45,820
(Christophe)  WordPress, maybe?

2449
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:47,580
(Fiorella)  Yeah, WordPress.

2450
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:53,100
(Fiorella)  I can do this in
WordPress, but only create from zero.

2451
02:31:00,220 --> 02:31:05,180
(Akim)  Guys, we didn't discuss
seafood, but seafood could be
interesting, by the way.

2452
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:07,900
(Ysam)  The frozen one.

2453
02:31:07,900 --> 02:31:08,700
(Ysam)  Yeah, the frozen one.

2454
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:09,200

(Ysam)  Yeah.

2457
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:18,940
(Fiorella)  No, I think it's not
available because we can continue
payment the web page.

2458
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:20,940
(Fiorella)  But I will...

2459
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:25,340
(Akim)  It's okay, it's okay if
you don't have it.

2460
02:31:25,340 --> 02:31:26,060
(Fiorella)  Avocados.

2461
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:27,100
(Fiorella)  I have a brochure.

02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:28,400

02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:38,620

02:31:40,060 --> 02:31:40,560
(Fiorella)  Someone...

2471
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:46,860
(Akim)  And what happened with
your previous partner?

2472
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:48,780
(Akim)  He passed away because of
the COVID?

2473
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:49,820
(Akim)  He died of the COVID?

2474
02:31:50,140 --> 02:31:54,540
(Fiorella)  Yeah, and he had
another...

2475
02:31:57,260 --> 02:31:58,060
(Fiorella)  Illness?

2476
02:31:58,060 --> 02:31:58,560
(Akim)  Disease?

2477
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:00,620
(Fiorella)  Disease, yes.

2478
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:04,860
(Fiorella)  During the years and
complicated with COVID, so...

2479
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:09,340
(Ysam)  Very nice document.

2480
02:32:10,460 --> 02:32:13,580
(Akim)  Was it like a friend of
you or someone you know for many years?

2481
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:18,700
(Fiorella)  He's my friend because I
was working with him during...

2482
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:24,620
(Fiorella)  Five years, more than 10
years ago.

2483
02:32:25,180 --> 02:32:29,180
(Fiorella)  We worked together in
entity and in a public entity for the
government,

2484
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:32,780
(Fiorella)  for Peruvian government,
and we do many things together.

2485
02:32:33,340 --> 02:32:37,420
(Fiorella)  So he told me, Firela, you
know the market, you have customers,

2486
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:40,540
(Fiorella)  you have experience in
export, in commercial, in first.

2487
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:44,140
(Fiorella)  I have experience in the
farms and packing house,

2488
02:32:44,140 --> 02:32:46,620
(Fiorella)  so we need to go together
something.

2489
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:51,580
(Fiorella)  Did you agree to work
together as a partner?

2490
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:52,700
(Fiorella)  Okay, let's go.

2491
02:32:55,820 --> 02:33:01,740
(Fiorella)  And when we start, the
COVID started slow.

2492
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:03,020
(Fiorella)  We have troubles with
this.

2493
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:05,680
(Fiorella)  Ah, here.

2494
02:33:07,100 --> 02:33:08,540
(Fiorella)  This is my creation.

2495
02:33:08,540 --> 02:33:10,140
(Fiorella)  All of this is my
creation.

2496
02:33:10,300 --> 02:33:14,620
(Fiorella)  The logo, the color, the
map, all of that.

2497
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:15,820
(Fiorella)  I sent my WhatsApp.

2498
02:33:16,380 --> 02:33:17,180
(Akim)  That's good.

2499
02:33:17,180 --> 02:33:18,460
(Akim)  I was reviewing it.

2500
02:33:18,460 --> 02:33:19,020
(Akim)  It's good.

2501
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:20,220
(Akim)  Yeah, good stuff.

2502
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:22,860
(Akim)  Guys, I think we have...

2503
02:33:24,220 --> 02:33:29,260
(Ysam)  Yeah, that's exactly, you
know, basically, exactly what you need,
no?

2504
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:29,980
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2505
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:35,980
(Ysam)  Calendar, details on the
box, region, specification, location,
perfect.

2506
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:39,100
(Akim)  And this is the variety,
right?

2507
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:44,620
(Akim)  You have variety as,
variety fuerte, then you have the red
globe, kimchon, sugar, citrus.

2508
02:33:44,620 --> 02:33:45,740
(Akim)  Okay, this is different.

2509
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:46,460
(Akim)  Blueberries.

2510
02:33:46,460 --> 02:33:47,820
(Akim)  Ah, you have different
blueberries.

2511
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:50,860
(Fiorella)  I can share with.

2512
02:33:50,860 --> 02:33:51,420
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2513
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:51,920
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

2514
02:33:52,700 --> 02:33:53,740
(Ysam)  There's different
blueberries.

2515
02:33:56,860 --> 02:33:58,780
(Fiorella)  This is my logo, my last
logo.

2516
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:00,080
(Akim)  Andeans.

2517
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:08,620
(Fiorella)  Okay, this is the fruit.

2518
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:13,980
(Fiorella)  Varieties, the
availability, location, the presentation
and certificates.

2519
02:34:15,580 --> 02:34:18,140
(Fiorella)  Grapes, the same as
grapes.

2520
02:34:20,300 --> 02:34:20,860
(Fiorella)  Citrus.

2521
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:26,140
(Fiorella)  The most common here is
morgoth and mignola.

2522
02:34:26,140 --> 02:34:27,980
(Fiorella)  Satsuma, pew.

2523
02:34:30,380 --> 02:34:31,260
(Fiorella)  Blueberries.

2524
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:33,820
(Fiorella)  There are a lot of
varieties now.

2525
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:38,220
(Fiorella)  The most common is veloxy,
ventura and emerald.

2526
02:34:39,020 --> 02:34:42,460
(Fiorella)  But there are other news,
sequoia and more of them.

2527
02:34:45,980 --> 02:34:49,100
(Akim)  And you have the different
color for the packaging every time or?

2528
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:52,060
(Fiorella)  No, it's only for the
brochure.

2529
02:34:52,060 --> 02:34:52,560
(Fiorella)  Ah, okay.

2530
02:34:54,220 --> 02:34:59,900
(Fiorella)  We can use a basic case
and we can add our.

2531
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:01,180
(Fiorella)  Yeah, yeah, I see, I see.

2532
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:02,780
(Fiorella)  And a sticker with our
logo.

2533
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:04,000
(Ysam)  Okay.

2534
02:35:04,860 --> 02:35:05,360
(Fiorella)  Ginger.

2535
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:10,140
(Fiorella)  This is the presentation
of ginger and no more.

2536
02:35:11,020 --> 02:35:11,660
(Fiorella)  And that's it.

2537
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:13,840
(Fiorella)  Nice.

2538
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:19,260
(Ysam)  Yeah, but even the logo is
nice.

2539
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:20,400
(Ysam)  I like it.

2540
02:35:21,100 --> 02:35:21,600
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2541
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:24,300
(Ysam)  Original, yeah, I like it,
yeah.

2542
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:27,100
(Ysam)  What means Andeans?

2543
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:29,340
(Ysam)  It's just a name or?

2544
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:29,840
(Ysam)  Andeans.

2545
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:31,060
(Ysam)  Andeans.

2546
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,160
(Christophe)  Because here is the
Andeans.

2547
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:37,840
(Ysam)  Ah, okay, I see, okay.

2548
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:39,120
(Ysam)  Ah, good, nice.

2549
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:39,620
(Ysam)  Okay.

2550
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:41,380
(Ysam)  Okay.

2551
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:43,760
(Akim)  That's good.

2552
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:50,800
(Akim)  And is it something we
can, I mean, we haven't figured out yet
how we want to,

2553
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:58,240
(Akim)  we have some ideas of the
brands and so on, but can we take your
brand as well or do you use it?

2554
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:03,200
(Fiorella)  I have a, no, I'm not
using, but I have a partner.

2555
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:13,120
(Fiorella)  We can modify some words
and the logo maybe.

2556
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:24,080
(Fiorella)  Because this logo is
registered in the copy here in Peru.

2557
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:24,880
(Akim)  Ah, okay, no worries.

2558
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:26,640
(Akim)  No, leave it like this
then, we have our own ideas.

2559
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:28,400
(Fiorella)  For me, no problem, but-

2560
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:29,920
(Akim)  No, we have our own ideas,
no worries.

2561
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:34,080
(Fiorella)  My partner have songs and-

2562
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:36,800
(Akim)  No, that's fine, that's
fine, we don't care.

2563
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:41,120
(Fiorella)  And maybe we can have some
troubles with him because-

2564
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:46,640
(Akim)  No, yeah, no worries, stop
it, we don't care, we will take
something else, no worries.

2565
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:53,440
(Fiorella)  But we can do some modify
in the colors and in the words and we
can use it, no problem.

2566
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:55,140
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2567
02:36:57,360 --> 02:37:01,200
(Akim)  And you have everything
here, so you have put vegetables, you
have put fruits,

2568
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:04,880
(Akim)  exotics, you have put
everything, it's a mix, right?

2569
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:09,440
(Akim)  You haven't split it
between fruits, exotic fruits and
vegetables, you haven't done that?

2570
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:12,800
(Fiorella)  No, together, all
together.

2571
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,160
(Akim)  All together, okay.

2572
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:19,920
(Fiorella)  Because fruits and
vegetables are fresh, the main category
is fresh.

2573
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:20,640
(Ysam)  Yeah, okay.

2574
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:24,160
(Fiorella)  So, we use all of that in
fresh.

2575
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:25,680
(Akim)  In fresh, okay.

2576
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:27,380
Okay.

2577
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:37,200
(Fiorella)  Christopher, you are a
designer also or only configure it and
checking all behind it?

2578
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:46,160
(Christophe)  I mean, for every
artistical aspect and so on, this is not
my cup of tea and I will rely on AI,

2579
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:49,120
(Christophe)  Midrone, Dali, you know,
this generative AI.

2580
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:55,600
(Christophe)  But for the rest,
infrastructure and how the seed should
be secure and build and so on,

2581
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:56,480
(Christophe)  this is my job, yeah.

2582
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:07,760
(Fiorella)  Because I'm asking that
because I'm working with a partner,
Creative Studio,

2583
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:14,000
(Fiorella)  that they can create a
special logo.

2584
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:15,540
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2585
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:20,160
(Fiorella)  The last that I work is...

2586
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:30,560
(Fiorella)  I am an international
sales, but one of my strengths is
develop brands or create new logos.

2587
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:35,840
(Fiorella)  So, the last one is – let
me check a brand book.

2588
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:43,200
(Fiorella)  I remember the one company
told me, Fidelia, I need your help
selling products, fresh fruits.

2589
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,800
(Fiorella)  Yeah, I said, okay, but
your logo is very, very awful.

2590
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,960
(Fiorella)  So, I need to change your
logo.

2591
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:51,540
(Fiorella)  Because...

2592
02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:57,280
(Akim)  In this business, you
agree, it's all about the packaging,
right?

2593
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,560
(Akim)  The quality and the
packaging.

2594
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:06,320
(Fiorella)  Yeah, but I think the
image of the company is very important
because when you open the

2595
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:14,160
(Fiorella)  website to transmit, if it
is a small, medium or high company, the
years of experience that

2596
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:16,560
(Fiorella)  you want to transmit
through the website.

2597
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:17,540
(Fiorella)  Mm-hmm.

2598
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:21,120
(Fiorella)  So...

2599
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:38,900
(Fiorella)  Here is...

2600
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:41,360
(Fiorella)  It's here.

2601
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:42,400
(Fiorella)  Let me check that.

2602
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:49,840
(Akim)  Yeah, just a quick
question, Chiola, while you check.

2603
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:52,720
(Akim)  Do you have dates in Peru
or not?

2604
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:56,080
(Akim)  I mean, like, palms and so
on, with dates or not at all?

2605
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:57,360
(Akim)  You don't have that?

2606
02:39:58,560 --> 02:39:59,440
(Fiorella)  What, what?

2607
02:39:59,440 --> 02:39:59,940
(Akim)  Dates.

2608
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:03,620
(Fiorella)  Dates?

2609
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:12,720
(Fiorella)  I can listen, Issam.

2610
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:14,660
(Ysam)  Okay.

2611
02:40:15,140 --> 02:40:17,300
(Ysam)  No, it's a black, it's a
black product.

2612
02:40:17,300 --> 02:40:20,420
(Ysam)  If I know, it's a black
fruit from Arabic country.

2613
02:40:20,420 --> 02:40:22,500
(Ysam)  They're eating that for
during Ramadan, you know?

2614
02:40:23,380 --> 02:40:24,740
(Ysam)  Dates, you don't have that
in Peru?

2615
02:40:24,740 --> 02:40:27,940
(Ysam)  Dates, wait, I will
translate you.

2616
02:40:31,060 --> 02:40:33,380
(Fiorella)  Like, dates is datil?

2617
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:35,940
(Ysam)  Datil, datil, exactly,
datil.

2618
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:37,700
(Ysam)  Yeah, datiles de
frutasieria.

2619
02:40:37,700 --> 02:40:38,820
(Akim)  Yeah, datil.

2620
02:40:38,820 --> 02:40:40,260
(Fiorella)  We import datil.

2621
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:41,700
(Akim)  Ah, you import datil?

2622
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,200
(Akim)  Oh.

2623
02:40:42,820 --> 02:40:44,420
(Akim)  We don't produce, we
import.

2624
02:40:45,380 --> 02:40:46,500
(Akim)  Which kind of datil?

2625
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:48,500
(Akim)  Is it like medjool or
degetul?

2626
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:49,780
(Akim)  What datils do you import?

2627
02:40:49,780 --> 02:40:50,280
(Akim)  You don't know?

2628
02:40:51,940 --> 02:40:53,380
(Fiorella)  This is not my business, I
don't know.

2629
02:40:54,260 --> 02:40:55,140
(Akim)  No, no, that's fine.

2630
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:58,500
(Akim)  I said, can you check why
they import datil?

2631
02:40:58,500 --> 02:40:59,060
(Akim)  To do what?

2632
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:01,700
(Fiorella)  I can check it in the
Veritrade.

2633
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:07,460
(Fiorella)  This is an intelligence
page for import and export.

2634
02:41:07,460 --> 02:41:09,780
(Akim)  Okay, because we can have
datil.

2635
02:41:09,780 --> 02:41:10,900
(Akim)  We have datil, actually.

2636
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:13,460
(Akim)  Yes, we can import.

2637
02:41:14,740 --> 02:41:16,660
(Akim)  It's coming from Morocco
and Algeria.

2638
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:18,900
(Fiorella)  Maybe from Morocco.

2639
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:20,580
(Ysam)  Yeah, and we have volume.

2640
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:23,140
(Fiorella)  This is the last logo.

2641
02:41:24,980 --> 02:41:27,380
(Fiorella)  And when the general
manager told me,

2642
02:41:27,380 --> 02:41:31,220
(Fiorella)  Firela, I want to work
with you because I need to sell my
fruit.

2643
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:35,780
(Fiorella)  Okay, but your logo is
very awful and I don't sell nothing
about apples.

2644
02:41:35,780 --> 02:41:37,220
(Fiorella)  So I need to change.

2645
02:41:37,220 --> 02:41:40,260
(Fiorella)  I changed this logo, the
last, with this.

2646
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:42,600
(Akim)  Okay.

2647
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:46,100
(Akim)  Can you put it bigger like
that we see it?

2648
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:47,940
(Fiorella)  Yeah, this is the logo.

2649
02:41:50,180 --> 02:41:53,780
(Fiorella)  I will show the brand book
of this.

2650
02:41:53,780 --> 02:41:54,420
(Fiorella)  Ah, okay.

2651
02:41:55,060 --> 02:41:56,340
(Fiorella)  I constructed this logo.

2652
02:41:57,060 --> 02:42:03,380
(Fiorella)  It's very important to
know how is the experience.

2653
02:42:03,380 --> 02:42:10,820
(Fiorella)  How do you want the people
out of this company want to recognize?

2654
02:42:11,380 --> 02:42:12,180
(Fiorella)  Oh, yeah.

2655
02:42:13,460 --> 02:42:24,660
(Fiorella)  So we can use these
colors, the complement, because of the
sector of the business.

2656
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:34,580
(Fiorella)  And the final logo is
totally different of the first logo.

2657
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:36,500
(Akim)  Yeah, del Perú para el
Mundo.

2658
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:37,000
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2659
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:38,840
(Fiorella)  Yes.

2660
02:42:40,820 --> 02:42:51,540
(Fiorella)  So, the sizes, colors, and
the things that we can don't do.

2661
02:42:57,700 --> 02:43:07,540
(Fiorella)  The elements of the words,
determine the type of words that we can
use.

2662
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:12,660
(Fiorella)  Photos are very clean.

2663
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:14,900
(Fiorella)  Yeah, I can see that,
yeah.

2664
02:43:15,620 --> 02:43:16,660
(Fiorella)  High quality.

2665
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:17,160
(Akim)  Yeah.

2666
02:43:20,900 --> 02:43:21,400
(Akim)  Okay.

2667
02:43:22,180 --> 02:43:24,500
(Fiorella)  Incorrect forms to use the
photos.

2668
02:43:24,500 --> 02:43:25,220
(Fiorella)  Yeah, yeah, you're right.

2669
02:43:25,220 --> 02:43:27,380
(Akim)  But this banana is not
okay.

2670
02:43:28,580 --> 02:43:29,380
(Fiorella)  Merchandise.

2671
02:43:30,740 --> 02:43:32,100
(Akim)  You did that for the
company?

2672
02:43:33,700 --> 02:43:36,020
(Fiorella)  Yeah, together with
Creative Studio.

2673
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:40,100
(Akim)  Creative Studio, it's a
design company in Peru.

2674
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:49,220
(Fiorella)  It's based in Peru, but
all of this is my creation, because I
talked to the Creative Studio.

2675
02:43:49,220 --> 02:43:50,420
(Fiorella)  I want these colors.

2676
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:57,540
(Fiorella)  I think it's good for this
company to mention that they have an
experience in this business

2677
02:43:57,540 --> 02:43:58,580
(Fiorella)  more than 10 years.

2678
02:43:59,460 --> 02:44:04,100
(Fiorella)  I put all of in brief, and
together with the studio, we create
this.

2679
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:08,020
(Fiorella)  But I am the…

2680
02:44:10,820 --> 02:44:11,380
(Ysam)  Is it you?

2681
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:13,460
(Ysam)  Did you work with Ana
Lucia on this, or no?

2682
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:15,320
(Ysam)  What?

2683
02:44:15,700 --> 02:44:16,200
(Ysam)  Sorry.

2684
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:18,420
(Ysam)  Did you work with Ana
Lucia on the design, or never?

2685
02:44:19,860 --> 02:44:20,660
(Ysam)  No, never.

2686
02:44:20,660 --> 02:44:24,260
(Ysam)  Okay, just for this
question, because I know she worked on
this.

2687
02:44:24,260 --> 02:44:26,420
(Fiorella)  I don't know Ana Lucia
before…

2688
02:44:28,340 --> 02:44:31,060
(Fiorella)  When we met only, because
before, I don't know her.

2689
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:31,700
(Ysam)  Ah, really?

2690
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:32,660
(Ysam)  Okay, okay, okay.

2691
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:36,180
(Fiorella)  And this is part of the
merchandise.

2692
02:44:37,780 --> 02:44:38,500
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

2693
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:39,220
(Fiorella)  The cases.

2694
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:42,740
(Akim)  Okay, interesting.

2695
02:44:46,740 --> 02:44:47,540
(Fiorella)  And the container.

2696
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:49,620
(Akim)  The container, okay.

2697
02:44:51,220 --> 02:44:52,340
(Akim)  Fernanda, okay.

2698
02:44:53,220 --> 02:44:53,860
(Fiorella)  Yeah, that's it.

2699
02:44:55,700 --> 02:44:56,340
(Fiorella)  I like it.

2700
02:44:56,340 --> 02:44:57,780
(Fiorella)  I like it to create, to…

2701
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:59,060
(Fiorella)  No, it's a good one.

2702
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:02,420
(Akim)  Is it kind of specific
meaning, Chavarri?

2703
02:45:02,420 --> 02:45:04,740
(Akim)  Does that mean something
in Spanish?

2704
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:07,620
(Fiorella)  No, it's a surname.

2705
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:08,580
(Akim)  Surname, okay.

2706
02:45:08,580 --> 02:45:10,420
(Fiorella)  Surname of the general
manager.

2707
02:45:11,540 --> 02:45:13,220
(Akim)  Okay, Chavarri.

2708
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:14,180
(Fiorella)  It's a small company.

2709
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:16,900
(Fiorella)  Okay, cool.

2710
02:45:16,900 --> 02:45:24,500
(Fiorella)  But if you look at the
first logo, what can you imagine of this
company?

2711
02:45:24,500 --> 02:45:27,220
(Fiorella)  Of this, the first logo,
that is red, apple, and…

2712
02:45:28,260 --> 02:45:30,500
(Akim)  Yeah, it's a fruit
company.

2713
02:45:30,500 --> 02:45:32,740
(Akim)  It's a good one, with the
sun and so on.

2714
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:34,020
(Akim)  Looking good.

2715
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:39,780
(Christophe)  No, she was talking about
the first one, where you see, like, a
tomato apple.

2716
02:45:39,780 --> 02:45:40,280
(Christophe)  No, the first one.

2717
02:45:41,380 --> 02:45:42,180
(Akim)  No, this one, no, no.

2718
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:43,860
(Akim)  This one is not good, no,
no.

2719
02:45:43,860 --> 02:45:44,580
(Akim)  This one is, yeah.

2720
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:45,220
(Fiorella)  What do you think about
that?

2721
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:51,540
(Fiorella)  If you compare this one,
what do you think about this company?

2722
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:53,860
(Fiorella)  And what do you think
about the other logo?

2723
02:45:54,500 --> 02:45:57,220
(Akim)  No, the other one is much
more modern and…

2724
02:45:57,220 --> 02:45:57,860
(Akim)  Professional.

2725
02:45:57,860 --> 02:45:58,580
(Akim)  Yeah, professional.

2726
02:45:58,580 --> 02:45:59,220
(Ysam)  Professional, yeah.

2727
02:46:01,300 --> 02:46:06,500
(Fiorella)  If you see, this is an
informal, and they don't have a lot of
experience.

2728
02:46:06,580 --> 02:46:11,220
(Fiorella)  And if you compare with
this, oh, this is a formal company,
strong,

2729
02:46:11,940 --> 02:46:14,420
(Fiorella)  with a lot of experience
in this business, no?

2730
02:46:16,020 --> 02:46:16,660
(Christophe)  Definitely.

2731
02:46:16,660 --> 02:46:17,220
(Fiorella)  Very different.

2732
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:20,660
(Akim)  Then, I have one question,
Aldo Fiorella.

2733
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:24,820
(Akim)  You know, you send us the
catalog with avocados, grapes, and so
on,

2734
02:46:24,820 --> 02:46:27,220
(Akim)  but with the different
varieties and so on.

2735
02:46:27,220 --> 02:46:28,340
(Akim)  But where is the price?

2736
02:46:28,340 --> 02:46:29,860
(Akim)  You don't put the price in
the catalog?

2737
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:31,380
(Akim)  No, never.

2738
02:46:31,380 --> 02:46:31,860
(Akim)  Never, okay.

2739
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:35,780
(Akim)  So, the price is dependent
on the discussions you're having with
the different customers, right?

2740
02:46:35,780 --> 02:46:36,420
(Akim)  So, it depends.

2741
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:41,460
(Fiorella)  Not only of the discussion
of each customer, it depends on the
market.

2742
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:45,620
(Fiorella)  It depends on the season,
because every season is totally
different.

2743
02:46:45,620 --> 02:46:48,260
(Fiorella)  The last season for
avocado was wrong.

2744
02:46:52,820 --> 02:46:57,460
(Fiorella)  And the last of the last
is good, and the grapes are the same.

2745
02:46:57,460 --> 02:46:59,860
(Fiorella)  So, each season is totally
different.

2746
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:07,220
(Fiorella)  So, we cannot negotiate
with the customers until the season
starts, for example.

2747
02:47:08,260 --> 02:47:11,380
(Fiorella)  Now, we are in the ginger
season.

2748
02:47:12,020 --> 02:47:17,540
(Fiorella)  So, if a customer is
asking me prices in February, March, I
said, I don't know.

2749
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:24,100
(Fiorella)  I can give you a price,
because we don't know how is the
structure of the coast.

2750
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:25,780
(Fiorella)  We don't know how is the
market.

2751
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:31,620
(Fiorella)  So, it's impossible that I
give you a price three or four months
before.

2752
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:38,020
(Ysam)  But can we find an
agreement, for example, if we have a
request from a customer for a specific

2753
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:40,980
(Ysam)  volume for the next six or
eight months?

2754
02:47:41,540 --> 02:47:44,900
(Ysam)  Can we manage to discuss
with the farmer on the fixed price?

2755
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:47,380
(Fiorella)  It depends.

2756
02:47:48,820 --> 02:47:51,940
(Fiorella)  It depends on the producer
of the spoil, because...

2757
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:52,840
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

2758
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:55,700
(Akim)  Let's say tomorrow
Carrefour.

2759
02:47:56,420 --> 02:48:02,420
(Fiorella)  Maybe in some products,
you can fix up a price as a minimum
warranty.

2760
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:03,800
(Ysam)  Potatoes?

2761
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:10,740
(Fiorella)  No, for fresh fruit, you
can manage a minimum warranty price,
because

2762
02:48:11,460 --> 02:48:13,940
(Fiorella)  we know how is the minimum
warranty.

2763
02:48:14,900 --> 02:48:21,940
(Fiorella)  And then, when you sell
it, you can give a liquidation and we
can check the best price,

2764
02:48:21,940 --> 02:48:27,140
(Fiorella)  because obviously, as a
customer, if you want to continue doing
business with me,

2765
02:48:27,780 --> 02:48:32,820
(Fiorella)  you can do it the best
effort to give the best profit for us.

2766
02:48:33,940 --> 02:48:41,380
(Fiorella)  So, in this situation, we
receive the liquidation and the other
part of the sales.

2767
02:48:41,380 --> 02:48:43,540
(Fiorella)  That is plus the minimum
warranty.

2768
02:48:43,940 --> 02:48:51,540
(Fiorella)  For example, in avocado,
if the minimum warranty is 11, we need
to receive 11 when the fruit

2769
02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:54,900
(Fiorella)  arrives to Destiny, or
before.

2770
02:48:54,900 --> 02:49:01,780
(Fiorella)  It depends, because we can
manage or negotiate against copy of
documents.

2771
02:49:01,780 --> 02:49:04,020
(Fiorella)  Minimum warranty, 11 of 10
dollars.

2772
02:49:04,900 --> 02:49:12,660
(Fiorella)  Then, when you sell it at
20 or 30, maximum 30 days, you can give
me the liquidation and

2773
02:49:14,180 --> 02:49:17,620
(Fiorella)  transfer the rest of the
amount for the sell it.

2774
02:49:19,540 --> 02:49:27,140
(Fiorella)  Nevertheless, if the
market is very bad, maybe, but in good
conditions, no.

2775
02:49:28,900 --> 02:49:40,260
(Fiorella)  And some other markets,
sometimes, for example, Asia, fix a
price during all the season,

2776
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:52,660
(Fiorella)  but you can negotiate in
terms of payment, 50%, 80% against a
document and the rest

2777
02:49:55,380 --> 02:50:01,060
(Fiorella)  when you receive the
fruit, a good arrival, and that's it.

2778
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:02,500
(Fiorella)  No liquidation.

2779
02:50:02,980 --> 02:50:12,420
(Fiorella)  Or the other form that is,
there are some companies work, it's a
consignee, but they

2780
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:21,140
(Fiorella)  also give a precision
advance to assure the fruit, because
there are a lot of importers

2781
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:23,140
(Fiorella)  that they want the fruit,
and it depends.

2782
02:50:23,140 --> 02:50:30,340
(Fiorella)  If it's blueberry, nobody
export give you a consignee.

2783
02:50:31,220 --> 02:50:41,140
(Fiorella)  They want to pre-advance
season or against copy of documents.

2784
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:43,380
(Fiorella)  It depends on the fruit.

2785
02:50:44,260 --> 02:50:44,900
(Akim)  Okay.

2786
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:50,660
(Akim)  Let's say, for instance,
Carrefour is asking us to have a program
for blueberries for the

2787
02:50:50,660 --> 02:50:51,140
(Akim)  year.

2788
02:50:51,140 --> 02:50:51,940
(Akim)  How do we proceed?

2789
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:58,180
(Akim)  And let's say they want
Emerald or blueberries or whatever.

2790
02:50:58,180 --> 02:51:07,060
(Fiorella)  That's a minimum warranty
against copy of documents and advance of
the, if you know

2791
02:51:07,060 --> 02:51:13,380
(Fiorella)  the customers, you can
say, okay, minimum warranty that much.

2792
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:24,180
(Fiorella)  If you don't know the
customer, give an advance upon the
purchase order and then against copy

2793
02:51:24,180 --> 02:51:32,180
(Fiorella)  of documents, and the rest
for liquidation, 20 days upon receive
the fruit.

2794
02:51:33,700 --> 02:51:34,200
(Fiorella)  No more.

2795
02:51:35,380 --> 02:51:40,020
(Akim)  So basically, Christophe,
next time when you discuss also with
Fiorella, you need to review

2796
02:51:40,020 --> 02:51:41,140
(Akim)  the transaction process.

2797
02:51:42,980 --> 02:51:47,220
(Akim)  I think it's very
important for us to have in mind
transaction process with those different

2798
02:51:47,220 --> 02:51:48,020
(Akim)  options like that.

2799
02:51:48,660 --> 02:51:53,780
(Akim)  We can basically do kind
of opt-in, opt-out every time and see
what is the best option

2800
02:51:53,780 --> 02:51:54,660
(Akim)  for us for the market.

2801
02:51:55,300 --> 02:51:55,800
(Akim)  Okay.

2802
02:51:56,580 --> 02:52:02,500
(Fiorella)  For example, now there are
some customer client that asked me,
okay, Fiorella, we need to

2803
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:09,700
(Fiorella)  want to forecast a program
for Russia, 10 containers, one per
month.

2804
02:52:10,260 --> 02:52:10,900
(Akim)  One per month.

2805
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:11,400
(Akim)  Okay.

2806
02:52:12,580 --> 02:52:15,620
(Fiorella)  He told me, could you give
me a fixed price?

2807
02:52:15,620 --> 02:52:22,420
(Fiorella)  Yes, no, because we don't
know what happened with Ginger because
the market is in movement

2808
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:32,420
(Fiorella)  and the cost for logistic
and producing is complicated.

2809
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:33,140
(Fiorella)  It's variety.

2810
02:52:33,780 --> 02:52:39,620
(Fiorella)  And also, there are less
product than the last season.

2811
02:52:40,660 --> 02:52:44,180
(Fiorella)  So the offer is not the
same as the last.

2812
02:52:44,180 --> 02:52:45,780
(Fiorella)  We don't have a lot of
demand.

2813
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:50,260
(Fiorella)  So the price is changing.

2814
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:53,780
(Fiorella)  The expecting is that the
price will change every month.

2815
02:52:54,420 --> 02:52:56,500
(Fiorella)  So I can give you a fixed
price.

2816
02:52:56,500 --> 02:53:03,220
(Fiorella)  I can give you a price
maybe for the two months, June and July,
for example, 20.

2817
02:53:03,860 --> 02:53:11,860
(Fiorella)  But we need to check at
the middle of July what is the behavior
of the prices for the

2818
02:53:11,860 --> 02:53:15,300
(Fiorella)  next two months.

2819
02:53:16,260 --> 02:53:24,660
(Fiorella)  And we can check each two
months because it's not a regular, it's
an isolated case.

2820
02:53:24,660 --> 02:53:27,620
(Fiorella)  We don't have a lot of
demand of Ginger.

2821
02:53:27,620 --> 02:53:30,100
(Fiorella)  It's less than the last
seasons.

2822
02:53:33,380 --> 02:53:39,300
(Fiorella)  This is the example
because it depends on each fruit or
vegetable.

2823
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:43,380
(Fiorella)  We can manage the
transaction and the terms and payment of
conditions.

2824
02:53:43,380 --> 02:53:50,900
(Akim)  Okay, let's do that.

2825
02:53:52,260 --> 02:53:53,380
(Akim)  I think we're good.

2826
02:53:53,380 --> 02:53:55,300
(Akim)  We nearly spent three
hours together.

2827
02:53:57,860 --> 02:53:59,060
(Akim)  We work hard.

2828
02:53:59,060 --> 02:54:00,100
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, but that's
fine.

2829
02:54:00,100 --> 02:54:00,580
(Akim)  That's fine.

2830
02:54:00,580 --> 02:54:05,700
(Akim)  I can see the benefits
here of working together and making that
happen.

2831
02:54:05,700 --> 02:54:10,500
(Akim)  Okay, Issam, Christophe,
anything else on your side?

2832
02:54:10,500 --> 02:54:11,540
(Akim)  And Fiorella, of course.

2833
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:18,580
(Akim)  No, good.

2834
02:54:18,580 --> 02:54:19,300
(Ysam)  No, it's fine.

2835
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:19,540
(Ysam)  Yeah.

2836
02:54:20,260 --> 02:54:22,980
(Akim)  Okay, Fiorella, we'll get
back to you in any case.

2837
02:54:24,020 --> 02:54:30,820
(Akim)  We will be also checking
with Issam the proposal, so it's
important for you.

2838
02:54:30,820 --> 02:54:36,420
(Akim)  If you have a company
that's pretty cool, check also if you
can reactivate it because

2839
02:54:36,420 --> 02:54:41,460
(Akim)  we don't need to create
one if you have already one.

2840
02:54:42,420 --> 02:54:47,460
(Akim)  Like that, we can do
smarter transactions and efficient
transactions with this one.

2841
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:51,940
(Akim)  And yeah, I think the idea
is really to start building the catalog
now.

2842
02:54:52,820 --> 02:54:56,500
(Akim)  If you can send us all the
catalogs you have like that, we can also

2843
02:54:57,540 --> 02:55:01,220
(Akim)  check what needs to be
done and what catalogs need to be
created here.

2844
02:55:01,860 --> 02:55:06,660
(Akim)  But yeah, I think there is
a lot of potential here for the markets
between

2845
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:08,500
(Akim)  Peru and Europe, but not
only.

2846
02:55:08,500 --> 02:55:09,860
(Akim)  You mentioned Russia.

2847
02:55:09,860 --> 02:55:11,780
(Akim)  We have contacts in Russia
with companies.

2848
02:55:11,780 --> 02:55:14,420
(Akim)  I don't know if you know
supermarkets called Mir and so on.

2849
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:15,540
(Akim)  We have contacts over
there.

2850
02:55:16,100 --> 02:55:17,860
(Akim)  So, in Middle East as
well.

2851
02:55:18,900 --> 02:55:25,940
(Akim)  So, yeah, let's try to
establish that framework of
collaboration and the catalog and take

2852
02:55:25,940 --> 02:55:26,420
(Akim)  it from there.

2853
02:55:26,420 --> 02:55:27,620
(Akim)  I think that's the basis.

2854
02:55:27,620 --> 02:55:29,700
(Akim)  And of course, the
communication around that.

2855
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:35,860
(Fiorella)  There are special trade
shops in Dubai for fresh fruits.

2856
02:55:36,980 --> 02:55:37,780
(Akim)  Gulf food, you mean?

2857
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:39,940
(Fiorella)  No, there are another.

2858
02:55:47,060 --> 02:55:48,020
(Fiorella)  It's not Gulf food.

2859
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:52,100
(Fiorella)  It's special for fresh
fruits.

2860
02:55:54,260 --> 02:55:54,740
(Akim)  What is it?

2861
02:55:58,020 --> 02:55:58,740
(Fiorella)  I forgot it.

2862
02:56:06,660 --> 02:56:07,300
(Ysam)  Gulf food, no?

2863
02:56:07,940 --> 02:56:08,440
(Fiorella)  No.

2864
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:09,560
(Ysam)  No?

2865
02:56:10,100 --> 02:56:10,600
(Fiorella)  No.

2866
02:56:12,740 --> 02:56:14,180
(Akim)  You speak French a little
bit.

2867
02:56:26,020 --> 02:56:28,420
(Akim)  No, for me Gulf food is
the main one, but I can check.

2868
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:50,100
(Ysam)  Yeah, world's largest food
exhibition, maybe they are for agro-
alimentation.

2869
02:56:50,100 --> 02:56:51,780
(Ysam)  Maybe there is one special
for fruits.

2870
02:56:52,420 --> 02:56:53,220
(Fiorella)  WAP Dubai.

2871
02:56:55,140 --> 02:57:01,460
(Fiorella)  It's a special fair for
fresh fruits.

2872
02:57:02,260 --> 02:57:05,380
(Ysam)  WAP, okay, W-A-P, WAP
Dubai.

2873
02:57:05,380 --> 02:57:05,880
(Ysam)  Okay.

2874
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:07,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah, this is...

2875
02:57:08,920 --> 02:57:09,420
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2876
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:11,320
(Akim)  Yeah, you're right, I'm on
it.

2877
02:57:11,320 --> 02:57:13,640
(Akim)  It's a Dubai World Trade
Center.

2878
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:15,080
(Akim)  Have you done it in the
past?

2879
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:20,040
(Fiorella)  Yeah, but a Gulf food, not
a WAP, Gulf food.

2880
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:20,600
(Akim)  Gulf food.

2881
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:22,680
(Akim)  And Gulf food is it worth?

2882
02:57:22,680 --> 02:57:24,200
(Akim)  Is it a good one, Gulf
food or not?

2883
02:57:25,400 --> 02:57:33,640
(Fiorella)  Yeah, it's good because
there are a lot of supermarkets and
importers, big dealers in

2884
02:57:33,640 --> 02:57:34,200
(Fiorella)  the business.

2885
02:57:34,920 --> 02:57:41,160
(Fiorella)  Gulf food is a good
threshold for two business for Middle
East because there are a lot of

2886
02:57:41,160 --> 02:57:52,760
(Fiorella)  people from Gulf that they
want to business from directly exporters
from fruits, from

2887
02:57:53,720 --> 02:57:57,000
(Fiorella)  dry products and canned
products.

2888
02:57:57,800 --> 02:58:06,600
(Fiorella)  I think this is one of the
strategic to promote fresh and dry
products from our company.

2889
02:58:07,640 --> 02:58:11,000
(Akim)  Okay, and what about fruit
attraction?

2890
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:12,760
(Akim)  It's a good one also,
fruit attraction?

2891
02:58:13,800 --> 02:58:15,800
(Fiorella)  Fruit attraction, yes,
it's good.

2892
02:58:17,240 --> 02:58:19,320
(Akim)  And what about the other
one in...

2893
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:21,160
(Fiorella)  In Spain, yes?

2894
02:58:21,160 --> 02:58:24,600
(Akim)  Yeah, in Spain, but there
is another one in Berlin also.

2895
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:25,480
(Akim)  Fruit Logistica.

2896
02:58:26,120 --> 02:58:27,240
(Akim)  No, Fruit Logistica.

2897
02:58:29,960 --> 02:58:32,840
(Fiorella)  Fruit Logistica Berlin or
Fruit Logistica Hong Kong?

2898
02:58:32,840 --> 02:58:33,640
(Akim)  Oh, Berlin.

2899
02:58:35,480 --> 02:58:36,360
(Fiorella)  It's good.

2900
02:58:36,360 --> 02:58:38,600
(Fiorella)  I was there last year.

2901
02:58:39,960 --> 02:58:40,600
(Akim)  It's a good one?

2902
02:58:41,400 --> 02:58:43,240
(Fiorella)  It's a good one, yeah.

2903
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:50,520
(Akim)  So, let's say if we do
WAP, if we do Gulf food, if we do fruit
attraction, Fruit Logistica,

2904
02:58:50,520 --> 02:58:52,600
(Akim)  are we good or do we need
to do another one?

2905
02:58:56,440 --> 02:59:02,200
(Fiorella)  Fruit Logistica Berlin is
one of the most important, but the other
one is Fruit Logistica

2906
02:59:02,200 --> 02:59:02,760
(Fiorella)  Hong Kong.

2907
02:59:03,640 --> 02:59:05,000
(Akim)  Hong Kong, okay.

2908
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:05,640
(Fiorella)  Hong Kong.

2909
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:06,360
(Akim)  Okay.

2910
02:59:06,360 --> 02:59:10,360
(Fiorella)  It's now in September.

2911
02:59:12,440 --> 02:59:12,940
(Ysam)  Okay.

2912
02:59:13,400 --> 02:59:13,900
(Fiorella)  Oh.

2913
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:15,260
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2914
02:59:16,200 --> 02:59:19,400
(Akim)  But this is especially for
the Asian market or what?

2915
02:59:20,840 --> 02:59:21,340
(Fiorella)  No.

2916
02:59:21,880 --> 02:59:22,380
(Fiorella)  No?

2917
02:59:23,100 --> 02:59:26,380
(Fiorella)  There are a lot of
participants from all the world.

2918
02:59:27,820 --> 02:59:31,980
(Akim)  But if we have to do one,
really, if you have to pick one, which
is the biggest one for you?

2919
02:59:38,700 --> 02:59:39,580
(Akim)  The one in Berlin?

2920
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:41,260
(Fiorella)  The biggest one?

2921
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:47,420
(Fiorella)  Berlin and Gulf food.

2922
02:59:49,500 --> 02:59:51,660
(Fiorella)  And also, Madrid.

2923
02:59:53,260 --> 02:59:53,760
Okay.

2924
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:00,160
(Ysam)  Okay.

2925
03:00:01,820 --> 03:00:06,700
(Fiorella)  I think it's very
important to participate in another
trade shows, I think.

2926
03:00:07,900 --> 03:00:11,740
(Fiorella)  The main goal is to try to
do the best in the big trade shows.

2927
03:00:12,380 --> 03:00:18,380
(Fiorella)  But there are some shows
that is specialized in fresh or in dry.

2928
03:00:19,340 --> 03:00:23,500
(Fiorella)  And there are not many
people knows and not many people to
participate.

2929
03:00:23,500 --> 03:00:26,460
(Fiorella)  So this is a special
segment and we can attack.

2930
03:00:27,500 --> 03:00:28,220
(Akim)  Yeah, that's true.

2931
03:00:28,220 --> 03:00:28,780
(Akim)  That's true.

2932
03:00:28,780 --> 03:00:29,280
(Akim)  Okay.

2933
03:00:30,940 --> 03:00:31,440
That's true.

2934
03:00:32,780 --> 03:00:39,900
(Akim)  We will try to get a booth
in Madrid and in Berlin, but we are just
building everything.

2935
03:00:40,460 --> 03:00:43,420
(Akim)  But if we can have a booth
in Madrid or in Berlin, that will be
great.

2936
03:00:43,420 --> 03:00:46,060
(Akim)  And if you want to join,
of course, that will be covered.

2937
03:00:46,060 --> 03:00:49,500
(Akim)  But yeah, I think that's
important for us to be represented in
those events.

2938
03:00:49,500 --> 03:00:50,220
(Akim)  I do agree with you.

2939
03:00:51,740 --> 03:00:55,340
(Fiorella)  If we start this year,
it's very important to participate in
Madrid.

2940
03:00:56,060 --> 03:00:56,780
(Akim)  In Madrid?

2941
03:00:56,780 --> 03:00:57,280
(Akim)  Okay.

2942
03:00:58,300 --> 03:01:01,180
(Akim)  And do you know that there
is also a Peru pavilion?

2943
03:01:01,180 --> 03:01:03,180
(Akim)  There is a Peru area in
this show?

2944
03:01:04,220 --> 03:01:04,720
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

2945
03:01:05,660 --> 03:01:06,620
(Akim)  Have you done it already?

2946
03:01:09,260 --> 03:01:10,060
(Fiorella)  In Madrid, no.

2947
03:01:10,060 --> 03:01:11,500
(Fiorella)  But in Berlin, yes.

2948
03:01:11,500 --> 03:01:12,220
(Akim)  In Berlin, yes.

2949
03:01:12,940 --> 03:01:16,540
(Akim)  Is it advantageous or not
to be part of the Peru area?

2950
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:31,820
(Fiorella)  It's very visited because
from Peru, there is a government
institution

2951
03:01:33,100 --> 03:01:36,220
(Fiorella)  promote the export for
superfoods.

2952
03:01:37,180 --> 03:01:43,660
(Fiorella)  I mean superfoods in terms
of dry, Asian grains and…

2953
03:01:45,020 --> 03:01:46,540
(Ysam)  Like Macau, Turmex?

2954
03:01:48,380 --> 03:01:49,340
(Ysam)  What you showed before?

2955
03:01:49,340 --> 03:01:56,460
(Fiorella)  Asian grains is cacao,
coffee, quinoa, chia, dry.

2956
03:01:57,420 --> 03:02:00,300
(Fiorella)  And also, they are
promoting super fresh fruits.

2957
03:02:01,420 --> 03:02:04,860
(Fiorella)  And they are promoting
super seafoods.

2958
03:02:05,820 --> 03:02:12,140
(Fiorella)  The big brand of Peru, the
strategy to promoting the export around
the world

2959
03:02:12,140 --> 03:02:13,900
(Fiorella)  is promoting the
superfoods.

2960
03:02:14,460 --> 03:02:22,620
(Fiorella)  Behind the superfoods is
super grains, super fresh, and super
seafood.

2961
03:02:23,580 --> 03:02:37,980
(Fiorella)  So, in this situation,
Peru is one of the country that is most
of visited from all the importers.

2962
03:02:39,180 --> 03:02:48,220
(Fiorella)  And most of them wants to
establish relationship in terms of
partners for Peruvian companies.

2963
03:02:48,220 --> 03:02:57,820
(Fiorella)  Due to the potential, we
are of the one of exporting grapes and
blueberries and also avocados around the
world.

2964
03:02:59,340 --> 03:03:00,060
And mongoes?

2965
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:07,260
(Fiorella)  Yeah, but not that big
volume like blueberries and avocados and
grapes, but yes.

2966
03:03:07,260 --> 03:03:08,620
(Fiorella)  Okay, yeah, I see what you
mean, yeah.

2967
03:03:12,620 --> 03:03:14,780
We have all here, all.

2968
03:03:15,500 --> 03:03:17,660
(Fiorella)  We have all here, all.

2969
03:03:18,380 --> 03:03:19,580
(Fiorella)  All kind of products.

2970
03:03:21,660 --> 03:03:25,820
(Akim)  That is why a lot of
people are interested by Peru, because
you have a lot of products.

2971
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:31,180
(Ysam)  And what crazy things, you
know, when she say all is from, you
know, usually we say people,

2972
03:03:31,180 --> 03:03:33,980
(Ysam)  country like to say we
have all.

2973
03:03:33,980 --> 03:03:38,940
(Ysam)  But Peru, I mean, in terms
of food, they really like, they really
have all, you know.

2974
03:03:38,940 --> 03:03:42,780
(Ysam)  They are importing just
some few products, like we talk about
dates, you know,

2975
03:03:42,780 --> 03:03:44,780
(Ysam)  datilas or small things
like that.

2976
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:49,100
(Ysam)  But most of the products,
they got it, you know, food, dry or
grain or everything.

2977
03:03:50,140 --> 03:03:51,820
(Ysam)  They got it and then
multiple variety.

2978
03:03:51,820 --> 03:03:56,780
(Ysam)  That's why it's just with
Peru, you can have all the products, you
know, so.

2979
03:03:57,740 --> 03:03:58,240
(Fiorella)  Okay.

2980
03:03:59,100 --> 03:03:59,820
(Fiorella)  Okay, Christophe.

2981
03:04:00,540 --> 03:04:01,040
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

2982
03:04:03,660 --> 03:04:08,860
(Fiorella)  And also, this institution
from Peru promote the visiting of the
pavilion.

2983
03:04:09,420 --> 03:04:19,660
(Fiorella)  Because they put in a chef
and this chef prepare dishes or desserts
with our products from Peru.

2984
03:04:21,100 --> 03:04:21,820
(Akim)  Ah, yeah.

2985
03:04:21,820 --> 03:04:25,420
(Akim)  A chef is preparing, okay,
preparing products from Peru, okay.

2986
03:04:25,420 --> 03:04:27,180
(Fiorella)  In the show, in the show,
in the show.

2987
03:04:27,180 --> 03:04:27,680
(Akim)  Okay.

2988
03:04:28,620 --> 03:04:30,700
(Akim)  And the other, and the
other.

2989
03:04:30,700 --> 03:04:37,500
(Akim)  One of my idea, if you
allow me to interrupt, is also to use
Peruvian products in big hotels

2990
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:39,180
(Akim)  in France with chef and so
on.

2991
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:43,500
(Akim)  You see, like you
mentioned the chocolate, the coffee,
could be the mangoes, the avocados

2992
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:43,900
(Akim)  and so on.

2993
03:04:43,900 --> 03:04:49,260
(Akim)  We want fresh foods also
to be provided to those five-star hotels
and so on.

2994
03:04:49,260 --> 03:04:53,900
(Akim)  Like that, they have fresh
products that they can sell to their
premium customer, you see.

2995
03:04:53,900 --> 03:04:58,540
(Akim)  Because those five-star
hotels, they have big customers coming
from all over the world

2996
03:04:58,540 --> 03:05:00,540
(Akim)  and they want to have
fresh products.

2997
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:04,300
(Akim)  So, we'll be able to
provide that to them through the
company.

2998
03:05:04,300 --> 03:05:07,740
(Akim)  That's what one of the
business line we want to have also.

2999
03:05:08,860 --> 03:05:13,420
(Fiorella)  Also, if we have a
Peruvian company, like a subcursor from
the head office,

3000
03:05:15,980 --> 03:05:20,620
(Fiorella)  we can participate at
Peruvian pavilion in the shows.

3001
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:31,420
(Fiorella)  Because the Peru rent the
biggest space for Peruvian companies and
the price is low.

3002
03:05:32,300 --> 03:05:38,060
(Fiorella)  Then, you can rent a
booth.

3003
03:05:38,060 --> 03:05:39,580
(Ysam)  Yeah, I see what you mean,
yeah.

3004
03:05:39,580 --> 03:05:41,740
(Fiorella)  As an individual company.

3005
03:05:41,740 --> 03:05:44,380
(Akim)  We were wondering that
because if we go to...

3006
03:05:44,380 --> 03:05:46,300
(Akim)  Let's say we are a Dutch
company.

3007
03:05:46,300 --> 03:05:51,020
(Akim)  We go there as a Dutch
company, we'll pay a higher cost than if
we go there as a Peruvian

3008
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:51,740
(Akim)  company, right?

3009
03:05:52,380 --> 03:05:55,580
(Fiorella)  Because we are behind the
Peruvian pavilion.

3010
03:05:55,580 --> 03:05:56,540
(Akim)  Pavilion, yeah, okay.

3011
03:05:57,500 --> 03:05:58,000
(Akim)  I see.

3012
03:05:58,620 --> 03:06:04,380
(Fiorella)  And we have more benefits
because the chef, because we have a
space there.

3013
03:06:05,180 --> 03:06:08,460
(Fiorella)  We can receive a visit in
our booth and have meetings.

3014
03:06:09,180 --> 03:06:13,900
(Fiorella)  They have exclusive rooms
for meetings if you don't have a space
in your booth.

3015
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:15,340
(Akim)  Yeah, I see.

3016
03:06:16,380 --> 03:06:19,100
(Akim)  How much does it cost to
have a booth like that in average?

3017
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:19,660
(Akim)  You don't know?

3018
03:06:19,660 --> 03:06:21,900
(Akim)  It depends on the show,
you would say, yeah.

3019
03:06:21,900 --> 03:06:30,220
(Fiorella)  When I will participate at
Fruit Logistics with my booth in Hong
Kong, it's around

3020
03:06:36,300 --> 03:06:40,780
(Fiorella)  $13,000 or $15,000 with
all.

3021
03:06:40,780 --> 03:06:51,660
(Fiorella)  I mean with the
decoration, with the table, chair, all
of that.

3022
03:06:52,220 --> 03:06:52,720
(Ysam)  $15,000?

3023
03:06:54,940 --> 03:06:55,660
(Ysam)  Okay.

3024
03:06:55,660 --> 03:06:56,160
(Fiorella)  Approx.

3025
03:06:57,020 --> 03:07:01,820
(Fiorella)  Or less because I consider
the merchandising, the bags.

3026
03:07:03,260 --> 03:07:04,460
(Akim)  The goodies, the goodies.

3027
03:07:04,460 --> 03:07:05,260
(Akim)  Yeah, the goodies.

3028
03:07:05,820 --> 03:07:06,320
(Akim)  Yeah.

3029
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:08,000
(Akim)  Okay.

3030
03:07:09,980 --> 03:07:12,300
(Akim)  So, you have traveled a
lot already in the past.

3031
03:07:14,380 --> 03:07:15,100
(Fiorella)  Sorry?

3032
03:07:15,100 --> 03:07:16,700
(Akim)  You have been everywhere
in the world.

3033
03:07:17,980 --> 03:07:18,480
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3034
03:07:18,960 --> 03:07:23,120
(Akim)  Have you come to France or
never?

3035
03:07:25,520 --> 03:07:29,760
(Fiorella)  Yeah, one time when I'm
going to Hong Kong.

(Ysam)  Eiffel Tower.

3040
03:07:38,320 --> 03:07:47,280
(Fiorella)  Only one day, visit the
Eiffel Tower and then go around this
space and come back to the airport.

3041
03:07:47,360 --> 03:07:47,860
(Akim)  Okay.

3042
03:07:48,560 --> 03:07:51,600
(Akim)  Have you been to the
Netherlands, to Rotterdam as well?

03:08:11,120 --> 03:08:11,620

3055
03:08:12,320 --> 03:08:13,440
(Akim)  You like United States?

(Fiorella)  Yeah, I like.

3057
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:16,240
(Fiorella)  For shopping.

3058
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:18,260
(Akim)  For shopping.

3059
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:19,840
(Akim)  Yeah, but...

3060
03:08:19,840 --> 03:08:21,200
(Akim)  For shopping on the beach.

3061
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:24,640
(Akim)  But you know, you don't
need to go to the United States for
shopping.

3062
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:27,280
(Akim)  Ralph Lauren, Tommy
Hilfiger is made in Peru.

3063
03:08:27,280 --> 03:08:28,560
(Akim)  Everything is made in
Peru.

3064
03:08:31,280 --> 03:08:32,160
(Fiorella)  Not all, but yeah.

3065
03:08:32,160 --> 03:08:32,960
(Fiorella)  Not all, some of...

3066
03:08:32,960 --> 03:08:36,240
(Fiorella)  Made in Vietnam, made in
China, made in Peru.

3067
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:37,680
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

3068
03:08:38,880 --> 03:08:42,080
(Fiorella)  Tommy in United States is
very cheap.

3069
03:08:42,080 --> 03:08:43,360
(Fiorella)  Here in Peru, it's
expensive.

3070
03:08:44,240 --> 03:08:44,720
(Akim)  Yeah.

3071
03:08:44,720 --> 03:08:46,160
(Akim)  But it's made in Peru.

3072
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:48,740
But the brand.

3073
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:51,760
(Ysam)  The brand, yeah.

3074
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:55,040
(Ysam)  In Peru, you got taxed
like crazy, you know?

3075
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:58,400
(Ysam)  Like example, when you're
going to buy an iPhone, it's crazy.

3076
03:08:58,400 --> 03:09:01,680
(Ysam)  They pay an iPhone much
more than us, you know?

3077
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:02,320
(Ysam)  It's crazy.

3078
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:07,040
(Akim)  Next time, I will
introduce one of my colleagues.

3079
03:09:07,040 --> 03:09:08,640
(Akim)  He lives and works in the
US.

3080
03:09:09,360 --> 03:09:11,440
(Akim)  He is in the San Francisco
area.

3081
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,880
(Akim)  And he will be our point
of contact for the business over there.

3082
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:16,100
(Akim)  Okay.

3083
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:19,060
(Akim)  Yeah, if you need to do
business with the US,

3084
03:09:19,060 --> 03:09:21,700
(Akim)  he will be our
representative over there.

3085
03:09:21,700 --> 03:09:24,340
(Akim)  And I think US is a huge
market also for us, you know?

3086
03:09:24,980 --> 03:09:28,660
(Akim)  Especially if you have
products from Peru that goes directly to
the US.

3087
03:09:28,660 --> 03:09:32,500
(Akim)  We don't need to get it
through water, then we can sell it
directly to the US.

3088
03:09:32,500 --> 03:09:36,900
(Akim)  But we have to, again, to
find the catalogs, the prospects and so
on.

3089
03:09:36,900 --> 03:09:39,460
(Akim)  And he's doing that work
already in parallel for us.

3090
03:09:39,460 --> 03:09:44,180
(Fiorella)  We can do a triangle
directly, avoiding the transit time, the
payments.

3091
03:09:44,180 --> 03:09:45,380
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

3092
03:09:46,500 --> 03:09:47,000
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3093
03:09:51,060 --> 03:09:53,300
(Akim)  Sorry, what do you sell in
the US generally?

3094
03:09:53,300 --> 03:09:57,140
(Akim)  You say, do you sell
grapes, avocado, blueberries in the US
mostly?

3095
03:09:58,100 --> 03:10:00,500
(Fiorella)  And canned products,
peppers.

3096
03:10:00,500 --> 03:10:01,220
(Akim)  Peppers, okay.

3097
03:10:03,380 --> 03:10:03,880
(Akim)  Tell me.

3098
03:10:04,580 --> 03:10:09,220
(Fiorella)  When do you have the
company setting okay?

3099
03:10:09,220 --> 03:10:14,900
(Fiorella)  Because I'm asking this
because Experimentaria is in September,
near.

3100
03:10:15,780 --> 03:10:25,220
(Fiorella)  And they have a special
treatment for buyers,

3101
03:10:25,780 --> 03:10:33,060
(Fiorella)  because they can pay the
flight and hotel when you visit to
Experimentaria show.

3102
03:10:33,060 --> 03:10:39,060
(Fiorella)  And they can prepare an
agenda for you, for any companies.

3103
03:10:39,780 --> 03:10:40,280
(Akim)  Okay.

3104
03:10:40,680 --> 03:10:45,000
(Fiorella)  And you can apply as a new
company, as a company,

3105
03:10:45,640 --> 03:10:51,320
(Fiorella)  import company, you can
apply to this category.

3106
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:58,360
(Akim)  So, the flight is paid and
the hotel is paid.

3107
03:10:58,360 --> 03:11:00,280
(Akim)  Everything is paid and we
can go there.

3108
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:07,480
(Fiorella)  It depends if you apply
according to the review of the procedure
and requirements.

3109
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:07,980
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3110
03:11:08,700 --> 03:11:13,420
(Akim)  So, basically, the company
will be done, we are in June.

3111
03:11:13,420 --> 03:11:16,540
(Akim)  It will be done between
July, August maximum.

3112
03:11:17,260 --> 03:11:18,460
(Akim)  We are making everything,
you know.

3113
03:11:19,900 --> 03:11:21,660
(Fiorella)  This is a hosted buyer
program.

3114
03:11:22,700 --> 03:11:24,300
(Akim)  Hosted buyer program,
okay.

3115
03:11:24,300 --> 03:11:29,500
(Fiorella)  Yeah, the hosted buyer
program, the benefits that they will
provide is

3116
03:11:33,500 --> 03:11:35,980
(Fiorella)  airport, hotel, and
transportation.

3117
03:11:36,780 --> 03:11:40,140
(Fiorella)  Free entry to the fair,
access to the big lounge for buyers.

3118
03:11:43,340 --> 03:11:49,500
(Fiorella)  I remember that they can
provide an agenda for the companies that
you are interested in.

3119
03:11:50,380 --> 03:11:51,100
(Akim)  Okay.

3120
03:11:51,100 --> 03:11:51,500
(Akim)  Thank you.

3121
03:11:51,500 --> 03:11:52,780
(Akim)  Thank you for that info.

3122
03:11:52,780 --> 03:11:53,580
(Akim)  I'll be frank with you.

3123
03:11:54,140 --> 03:11:55,100
(Akim)  That's a good info.

3124
03:11:56,060 --> 03:11:58,940
(Akim)  We don't especially need
them if we want to go to Peru.

3125
03:11:58,940 --> 03:12:00,780
(Akim)  But at the same time, it's
a big show.

3126
03:12:00,780 --> 03:12:02,780
(Akim)  There is a lot of people
to meet at the same time.

3127
03:12:02,780 --> 03:12:03,340
(Akim)  So, why not?

3128
03:12:03,340 --> 03:12:04,060
(Akim)  Yeah, good info.

3129
03:12:04,700 --> 03:12:05,200
(Akim)  Okay.

3130
03:12:05,680 --> 03:12:06,880
(Fiorella)  This is the webpage.

3131
03:12:09,040 --> 03:12:09,840
(Akim)  On the chat, okay.

3132
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:13,120
(Akim)  Issam, you want to go
there?

3133
03:12:16,640 --> 03:12:17,360
(Fiorella)  We can listen.

3134
03:12:20,160 --> 03:12:20,880
(Ysam)  Where is Issam?

3135
03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:22,800
(Ysam)  Sorry, yeah, I'm here,
yeah.

3136
03:12:22,800 --> 03:12:26,480
(Ysam)  No, no, I was telling you
that I'm already in there, you know.

3137
03:12:26,480 --> 03:12:31,040
(Ysam)  I'm checking now and I'm
already imagining myself in the show.

3138
03:12:31,920 --> 03:12:38,880
(Akim)  Because the thing is that,
Fiorella, there is this show and then
there is Madrid just after,

3139
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:39,680
(Akim)  you see.

3140
03:12:39,680 --> 03:12:43,120
(Akim)  So, beginning of October,
there is Madrid.

3141
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:48,080
(Akim)  So, Peru and then we have
to go back to Madrid, probably one week
after.

3142
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:51,040
(Fiorella)  Yeah, all together.

3143
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:51,840
(Akim)  Yeah, all together.

3144
03:12:52,720 --> 03:12:57,040
(Akim)  And at the same time, you
will be meeting the same people, you
know, coming from Peru to Madrid.

3145
03:12:58,000 --> 03:12:58,800
(Fiorella)  But it depends.

3146
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:00,560
(Fiorella)  It depends.

3147
03:13:00,560 --> 03:13:04,160
(Fiorella)  Because as I mentioned,
Madrid is specialized in fresh.

3148
03:13:04,160 --> 03:13:05,600
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah, you're right.

3149
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:09,360
(Fiorella)  And Experimentaria is more
dry and a little fresh.

3150
03:13:10,240 --> 03:13:11,680
(Fiorella)  So, it's not the same.

3151
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:12,740
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah.

3152
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:14,500
(Akim)  You're right.

3153
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:18,320
(Akim)  But anyway...

3154
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:19,920
(Akim)  We want to do both, so
that's fine.

3155
03:13:19,920 --> 03:13:20,420
(Akim)  Okay.

3156
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:26,560
(Ysam)  Anyway, that's the place
to be, to meet all the people of the
sector.

3157
03:13:27,280 --> 03:13:29,920
(Fiorella)  And if we do all the
papers...

3158
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:33,220
(Akim)  On time?

3159
03:13:33,840 --> 03:13:36,960
(Fiorella)  On time, you can apply to
this program.

3160
03:13:38,080 --> 03:13:41,920
(Fiorella)  And also, let me check if
we export with my...

3161
03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:43,760
(Ysam)  Company, yeah.

3162
03:13:43,760 --> 03:13:44,260
(Fiorella)  Company.

3163
03:13:46,320 --> 03:13:50,480
(Akim)  To be frank, that would be
easier because like that, you create the
company in Peru.

3164
03:13:50,480 --> 03:13:54,640
(Akim)  We would be finishing
creating the one in Rotterdam and then
we can start transacting.

3165
03:13:54,640 --> 03:13:55,140
(Akim)  You see?

3166
03:13:56,560 --> 03:14:01,520
(Fiorella)  No, my idea is that we can
apply to have a booth in Madrid.

3167
03:14:02,080 --> 03:14:03,040
(Akim)  Oh, yeah, also, yeah.

3168
03:14:03,040 --> 03:14:03,540
(Fiorella)  Behind...

3169
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:06,800
(Akim)  The Peruvian pavilion.

3170
03:14:06,800 --> 03:14:08,400
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's
true.

3171
03:14:08,400 --> 03:14:13,760
(Fiorella)  But I need the name
because I need to register the
commercial name, not as a...

3172
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:15,120
(Fiorella)  What is the name of the
company?

3173
03:14:16,720 --> 03:14:21,200
(Fiorella)  The name of the company
is, I don't know, Andes Fruits, maybe.

3174
03:14:22,320 --> 03:14:24,320
(Fiorella)  So, I need to have the
name.

3175
03:14:26,640 --> 03:14:27,520
(Fiorella)  Got it.

3176
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:30,000
(Fiorella)  And I can try to get a
booth.

3177
03:14:31,360 --> 03:14:33,680
(Akim)  Okay, what is the name of
your company?

3178
03:14:33,680 --> 03:14:35,360
(Akim)  Your own company has a
name or not?

3179
03:14:35,920 --> 03:14:36,800
(Fiorella)  My personal name.

3180
03:14:37,680 --> 03:14:40,880
(Fiorella)  It's a personal people
with business.

3181
03:14:42,240 --> 03:14:44,240
(Fiorella)  Personal Natural Con
Negocio.

3182
03:14:44,240 --> 03:14:46,960
(Fiorella)  This is the translation in
Spanish.

3183
03:14:46,960 --> 03:14:47,460
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3184
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:51,540
Okay.

3185
03:14:53,280 --> 03:14:54,160
(Akim)  Got it.

3186
03:14:54,160 --> 03:14:55,120
(Akim)  Okay, let us know.

3187
03:14:55,120 --> 03:14:59,840
(Akim)  So, you can see we have a
lot of things to do, a lot of things to
prepare in order to

3188
03:14:59,840 --> 03:15:01,280
(Akim)  be able to transact.

3189
03:15:01,280 --> 03:15:03,440
(Akim)  But the market is here,
definitely.

3190
03:15:03,440 --> 03:15:04,880
(Akim)  And we'll discuss that
next time.

3191
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:07,040
(Akim)  But we have a lot of
intelligence behind that.

3192
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:08,960
(Akim)  It's not just the three of
us.

3193
03:15:08,960 --> 03:15:14,400
(Akim)  We have a lot of people
and an AI machine helping us targeting
the right markets with

3194
03:15:14,400 --> 03:15:15,120
(Akim)  the right products.

3195
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:16,240
(Akim)  So, it's not just us.

3196
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:23,360
(Akim)  That's why we have
connections in Russia, in Middle East,
in Spain, obviously, in Morocco,

3197
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:28,640
(Akim)  in Egypt, also in the
north of Europe, in Germany, in the US.

3198
03:15:28,640 --> 03:15:31,520
(Akim)  Next time, I'll present to
you one of my colleagues in the US.

3199
03:15:31,520 --> 03:15:37,680
(Akim)  In Asia, I'm also having
someone covering Asia, specifically the
Philippines.

3200
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:39,840
(Akim)  There are mangoes in the
Philippines as well.

3201
03:15:39,840 --> 03:15:43,600
(Akim)  So, basically, all the
fruits and products that you want from
the Filipina, I can have

3202
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:44,480
(Akim)  them as well.

3203
03:15:44,480 --> 03:15:44,980
(Akim)  You see?

3204
03:15:45,440 --> 03:15:47,280
(Akim)  So, we are doing that as
well.

3205
03:15:47,280 --> 03:15:50,480
(Akim)  But, you know, it's a
step-by-step process.

3206
03:15:50,480 --> 03:15:52,480
(Akim)  And we build the
foundations here.

3207
03:15:53,600 --> 03:15:54,100
Okay.

3208
03:15:55,600 --> 03:15:56,100
(Fiorella)  Cool.

3209
03:15:57,200 --> 03:16:00,000
(Akim)  I'll ask Christophe once
her website is done.

3210
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:02,800
(Akim)  I'll ask Christophe to set
an hour or half an hour.

3211
03:16:02,800 --> 03:16:06,880
(Akim)  You can review her website
and give us your comments as well.

3212
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:07,600
(Akim)  Okay?

3213
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:09,440
(Akim)  The brand, I can give it
to you.

3214
03:16:09,440 --> 03:16:15,920
(Akim)  The brand will be named
Exoticas for exotic fruits only.

3215
03:16:15,920 --> 03:16:17,840
(Akim)  And then we have other
names for other brands.

3216
03:16:18,400 --> 03:16:23,600
(Fiorella)  And what is the mother
brand or the mother commercial name?

3217
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:26,640
(Akim)  We are still thinking
about it.

3218
03:16:26,640 --> 03:16:28,080
(Akim)  We did some.

3219
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:28,580
(Akim)  Yeah.

3220
03:16:29,440 --> 03:16:31,120
(Akim)  We have several proposals.

3221
03:16:31,120 --> 03:16:34,560
(Akim)  But the thing is that, how
to say that?

3222
03:16:35,440 --> 03:16:35,920
(Akim)  Okay.

3223
03:16:35,920 --> 03:16:42,560
(Akim)  There is one subsidiary
that will be doing fruits, vegetables,
and exotic fruits.

3224
03:16:42,560 --> 03:16:46,000
(Akim)  And then we have another
subsidiary will be doing something else.

3225
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:48,560
(Akim)  And another will be doing
something else.

3226
03:16:48,560 --> 03:16:51,600
(Akim)  And those subsidiaries
will be complementary to one each other.

3227
03:16:51,600 --> 03:16:52,100
(Akim)  You see?

3228
03:16:52,560 --> 03:16:53,440
(Akim)  So, that's kind of...

3229
03:16:54,160 --> 03:16:56,400
(Akim)  I'll show you one day more
structured way.

3230
03:16:56,400 --> 03:16:58,960
(Akim)  But it's something that
will be complementary.

3231
03:16:58,960 --> 03:17:00,080
(Akim)  And this is for something
special.

3232
03:17:00,080 --> 03:17:03,440
(Akim)  That's why, for instance,
I was asking for datil in Peru.

3233
03:17:03,440 --> 03:17:04,640
(Akim)  You don't have datil.

3234
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:05,440
(Akim)  But we have it.

3235
03:17:06,320 --> 03:17:07,040
(Akim)  We have it in...

3236
03:17:08,400 --> 03:17:12,640
(Fiorella)  We import cinnamon, datil,
nuts, some nuts.

3237
03:17:16,880 --> 03:17:17,680
(Fiorella)  Some spices.

3238
03:17:19,120 --> 03:17:19,620
(Akim)  Okay.

3239
03:17:21,440 --> 03:17:22,720
(Akim)  So, that's why I'm asking.

3240
03:17:22,720 --> 03:17:27,120
(Akim)  Because in our other
subsidiaries, we are able also to do the
importation process.

3241
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:29,920
(Akim)  So, datil, we have it
coming from Morocco.

3242
03:17:29,920 --> 03:17:31,760
(Akim)  We have datil named
Medjool.

3243
03:17:31,760 --> 03:17:32,880
(Akim)  It's a variety of datil.

3244
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:37,200
(Akim)  We have the other one in
Algeria called Degat Nour and others and
so on.

3245
03:17:37,200 --> 03:17:38,080
(Akim)  So, datil, we have it.

3246
03:17:38,080 --> 03:17:40,000
(Akim)  We can sell it to Peru as
well.

3247
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:40,720
(Akim)  So, you see?

3248
03:17:40,720 --> 03:17:42,960
(Akim)  It's not just Peru
exporting to Europe.

3249
03:17:42,960 --> 03:17:49,120
(Akim)  We are able also to
provide from North America, European
products to Peru as well.

3250
03:17:49,680 --> 03:17:51,200
(Akim)  So, it's a combination.

3251
03:17:52,080 --> 03:17:52,800
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3252
03:17:52,800 --> 03:17:53,280
(Akim)  Okay.

3253
03:17:53,280 --> 03:17:54,800
(Akim)  And what do you think
about Exoticas?

3254
03:17:54,800 --> 03:17:55,920
(Akim)  Is it a good name or not?

3255
03:17:58,160 --> 03:17:58,660
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3256
03:18:03,360 --> 03:18:08,560
(Ysam)  I think in our own
language, because my mother language is
Spanish,

3257
03:18:09,200 --> 03:18:12,320
(Ysam)  Exoticas means exotic, I
think.

3258
03:18:13,920 --> 03:18:15,280
(Ysam)  I think it means exotic,
yeah.

3259
03:18:16,160 --> 03:18:18,240
(Ysam)  For us, it's soon good,
you know?

3260
03:18:18,240 --> 03:18:19,120
(Ysam)  For us, because I think...

3261
03:18:19,120 --> 03:18:21,360
(Akim)  For us, it's kind of, you
know, Latin...

3262
03:18:21,360 --> 03:18:22,160
(Akim)  Exoticas.

3263
03:18:22,160 --> 03:18:25,040
(Akim)  Yeah, because if you say,
let's say, the other brand that you
showed up,

3264
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:27,840
(Akim)  Chavarri or whatever, for
us, it doesn't mean nothing, you see?

3265
03:18:28,560 --> 03:18:31,200
(Akim)  So, we have to link it to
the European knowledge.

3266
03:18:31,200 --> 03:18:37,760
(Akim)  If you say Exoticas, it's
kind of, oh, it's kind of Latin America,
exotic foods and so on.

3267
03:18:37,760 --> 03:18:38,240
(Fiorella)  See?

3268
03:18:38,240 --> 03:18:38,740
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3269
03:18:39,700 --> 03:18:45,620
(Fiorella)  Now, the brand is okay,
Exoticas, and it's easy to remember.

3270
03:18:45,620 --> 03:18:46,180
(Akim)  Exactly.

3271
03:18:46,180 --> 03:18:46,740
(Akim)  Exactly.

3272
03:18:46,740 --> 03:18:50,580
(Akim)  And it's also easy to
print, because you have to think about
the cost of printing

3273
03:18:50,580 --> 03:18:52,340
(Akim)  if you do packaging and so
on.

3274
03:18:52,340 --> 03:18:55,540
(Akim)  The fewer letters you
have, the better it is.

3275
03:18:57,220 --> 03:18:57,720
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3276
03:18:58,580 --> 03:19:01,220
(Fiorella)  And the complement is the
logo.

3277
03:19:01,220 --> 03:19:01,940
(Ysam)  Yeah, yeah, I agree.

3278
03:19:01,940 --> 03:19:06,820
(Fiorella)  Will include fruit and
vegetables, yeah?

3279
03:19:06,820 --> 03:19:08,340
(Fiorella)  And the colors is very
important.

3280
03:19:08,900 --> 03:19:13,460
(Akim)  Yeah, so basically, there
will be three lines of products.

3281
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:17,460
(Akim)  One will be fruits with
another name.

3282
03:19:17,460 --> 03:19:20,020
(Akim)  One will be exotic fruits
with Exoticas.

3283
03:19:20,020 --> 03:19:23,780
(Akim)  And then another one will
be vegetables with another name, you
see?

3284
03:19:24,420 --> 03:19:25,620
(Akim)  But you'll see there is a
link.

3285
03:19:25,620 --> 03:19:28,580
(Akim)  And they all have three
names, three brands.

3286
03:19:28,580 --> 03:19:32,740
(Akim)  And then we have another
brand for something particular with
Issam,

3287
03:19:32,740 --> 03:19:36,740
(Akim)  with Datil and other
products coming from North Africa and so
on, you see?

3288
03:19:36,740 --> 03:19:38,900
(Akim)  Because in Middle East and
North Africa,

3289
03:19:38,900 --> 03:19:41,300
(Akim)  there are also a lot of
products like tomatoes.

3290
03:19:42,340 --> 03:19:45,060
(Akim)  In Egypt, you have
mangoes, you have apples, and so on.

3291
03:19:45,060 --> 03:19:49,780
(Akim)  We're going also to take
those products from Morocco, Algeria,
Egypt,

3292
03:19:51,460 --> 03:19:52,820
(Akim)  and sell that to the
market.

3293
03:19:52,820 --> 03:19:55,140
(Akim)  It could be in Middle
East, it could be in Europe,

3294
03:19:55,140 --> 03:19:58,500
(Akim)  and it could be also in
America, Latin America, North America.

3295
03:20:00,420 --> 03:20:00,920
(Fiorella)  You see?

3296
03:20:01,560 --> 03:20:09,320
(Akim)  The idea is to make a
combination of all the production
capacity that we're going to have.

3297
03:20:11,480 --> 03:20:11,980
(Akim)  Okay?

3298
03:20:12,840 --> 03:20:16,200
(Fiorella)  When you said Exoticas,
it's a...

3299
03:20:16,200 --> 03:20:17,160
(Akim)  You like it or not?

3300
03:20:19,640 --> 03:20:20,520
(Akim)  Be frank with us.

3301
03:20:20,520 --> 03:20:21,080
(Akim)  It's okay.

3302
03:20:21,080 --> 03:20:23,240
(Akim)  If you don't like it, you
can still change.

3303
03:20:23,880 --> 03:20:26,520
(Fiorella)  I can imagine a colorful
logo.

3304
03:20:27,560 --> 03:20:28,060
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3305
03:20:28,360 --> 03:20:29,560
(Fiorella)  Very, very nice.

3306
03:20:30,280 --> 03:20:34,520
(Fiorella)  Very, very, very funny,
very happy.

3307
03:20:36,040 --> 03:20:37,320
(Fiorella)  Okay, yeah, yeah.

3308
03:20:37,320 --> 03:20:44,120
(Fiorella)  The inside, when you're
thinking in exotics, it's a very
colorful, very nice, very happy.

3309
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:45,160
(Akim)  Yeah, exactly.

3310
03:20:45,160 --> 03:20:47,320
(Akim)  And you know why we have
taken Exoticas?

3311
03:20:47,320 --> 03:20:48,040
(Akim)  It's very simple.

3312
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:54,360
(Akim)  Because we want to export
exotic products, fruits from all Latin
America.

3313
03:20:54,360 --> 03:20:57,640
(Akim)  If we say Peruvian
products, that's a limitation for us.

3314
03:20:57,640 --> 03:21:00,360
(Akim)  Because if tomorrow we
have pineapples from Costa Rica,

3315
03:21:00,360 --> 03:21:03,640
(Akim)  or if we have strawberries
from Mexico, we don't care.

3316
03:21:03,640 --> 03:21:05,960
(Akim)  We put it in the Exoticas
brand, and that's it.

3317
03:21:05,960 --> 03:21:07,080
(Akim)  You see what I mean?

3318
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:11,720
(Akim)  And people, they don't
care if it comes from Peru, or Mexico,
Costa Rica.

3319
03:21:11,720 --> 03:21:13,640
(Akim)  They want the quality at
the end of the day.

3320
03:21:13,640 --> 03:21:15,800
(Akim)  We can mark, you know,
made in Peru, whatever.

3321
03:21:15,800 --> 03:21:17,320
(Akim)  But they want the quality.

3322
03:21:17,320 --> 03:21:19,240
(Akim)  What matters here is the
quality.

3323
03:21:19,240 --> 03:21:20,520
(Akim)  And then why it's
important?

3324
03:21:20,520 --> 03:21:24,920
(Akim)  Because if we have the
quality, then we can put a price tag
against the quality.

3325
03:21:24,920 --> 03:21:28,120
(Akim)  And say, okay, you have to
pay more expensive,

3326
03:21:28,120 --> 03:21:30,600
(Akim)  because there is the
quality in front of it.

3327
03:21:30,600 --> 03:21:31,160
(Akim)  You see?

3328
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:34,680
(Akim)  It's not just a product
you find in the supermarket or whatever.

3329
03:21:34,680 --> 03:21:36,520
(Akim)  We want to target high-
range products.

3330
03:21:38,440 --> 03:21:39,080
(Ysam)  Yes.

3331
03:21:39,080 --> 03:21:42,440
(Akim)  Because on high-range
products, we can make highest margin.

3332
03:21:42,440 --> 03:21:43,240
(Fiorella)  As a premium.

3333
03:21:44,120 --> 03:21:44,840
(Akim)  Exactly.

3334
03:21:44,840 --> 03:21:45,800
(Fiorella)  Premium category.

3335
03:21:46,360 --> 03:21:46,840
(Akim)  Exactly.

3336
03:21:46,840 --> 03:21:47,560
(Akim)  Always.

3337
03:21:47,560 --> 03:21:48,040
(Akim)  Exactly.

3338
03:21:48,920 --> 03:21:53,160
(Akim)  And that's funny you say
that, because it will be called
Exoticas.

3339
03:21:53,160 --> 03:21:59,400
(Akim)  And Exoticas, it will be
behind, just at the bottom, it will be
called Premium.

3340
03:22:01,320 --> 03:22:02,120
(Akim)  You see?

3341
03:22:02,120 --> 03:22:04,360
(Akim)  Like that, we have
Exoticas and Premium.

3342
03:22:04,360 --> 03:22:05,960
(Akim)  And like that, we sell
that to the market.

3343
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:08,840
(Fiorella)  VIP exotic fruits.

3344
03:22:09,560 --> 03:22:11,080
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah.

3345
03:22:11,080 --> 03:22:13,000
(Akim)  VIP exotic fruits.

3346
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:18,840
(Akim)  Some people are saying,
yeah, eating different, eating, what's
the other?

3347
03:22:18,840 --> 03:22:20,360
Eating fruits stay cute, right?

3348
03:22:20,920 --> 03:22:28,440
(Akim)  Issam made a logo, eating
fruits stay cute, or eating different.

3349
03:22:29,320 --> 03:22:31,960
(Akim)  We need to find some
slogan, but it's easy.

3350
03:22:31,960 --> 03:22:34,760
(Akim)  And why it's important for
me to have those videos?

3351
03:22:34,760 --> 03:22:39,240
(Akim)  Because if you make those
videos with the producers and so on, it
means quality.

3352
03:22:39,240 --> 03:22:41,960
(Akim)  And we are not, you know,
bullshitting the consumers.

3353
03:22:41,960 --> 03:22:42,920
(Akim)  It's real quality.

3354
03:22:42,920 --> 03:22:46,840
(Akim)  And they see exactly what
is behind the avocado, the mango, and
this and that.

3355
03:22:46,840 --> 03:22:47,240
(Akim)  You see?

3356
03:22:47,240 --> 03:22:47,960
(Akim)  That's the idea.

3357
03:22:48,760 --> 03:22:50,600
(Akim)  And then we can use the
blogs and so on.

3358
03:22:52,280 --> 03:22:52,520
Yeah.

3359
03:22:53,560 --> 03:22:56,200
(Fiorella)  Christopher, what is the
plan?

3360
03:22:56,200 --> 03:23:01,720
(Fiorella)  If you're coming in
September, I understand, or it's my
misunderstanding?

3361
03:23:04,040 --> 03:23:05,080
(Fiorella)  You mean in Peru?

3362
03:23:05,080 --> 03:23:05,640
(Ysam)  In Peru?

3363
03:23:05,640 --> 03:23:06,360
(Ysam)  Uh-huh.

3364
03:23:06,360 --> 03:23:07,320
(Fiorella)  For Experimentaria, no.

3365
03:23:08,360 --> 03:23:12,040
(Ysam)  Oh, but then you will see
if we have to, if we are ready to
confirm.

3366
03:23:12,040 --> 03:23:12,600
(Ysam)  We'll see that.

3367
03:23:12,600 --> 03:23:14,440
(Ysam)  It's not mandatory, but
we'll see that.

3368
03:23:14,440 --> 03:23:15,160
(Akim)  Yeah, we'll see that.

3369
03:23:15,880 --> 03:23:20,600
(Akim)  But basically, what we
want to do, and I'll give you the idea,

3370
03:23:21,720 --> 03:23:24,360
(Akim)  Christophe that you've
seen will be the CTO of the company.

3371
03:23:25,080 --> 03:23:25,320
(Akim)  Okay?

3372
03:23:26,440 --> 03:23:29,560
(Akim)  Me and Issam will be CEOs
or CROs.

3373
03:23:29,560 --> 03:23:30,200
(Akim)  It depends.

3374
03:23:30,200 --> 03:23:31,080
(Akim)  We don't care.

3375
03:23:31,080 --> 03:23:35,640
(Akim)  And if you want to join
the adventure, you will be our chief
marketing officer or something

3376
03:23:35,640 --> 03:23:36,200
(Akim)  like this.

3377
03:23:36,200 --> 03:23:36,840
(Akim)  You know?

3378
03:23:36,840 --> 03:23:37,400
(Akim)  Very easy.

3379
03:23:38,360 --> 03:23:47,320
(Fiorella)  No, I'm asking about that
if you come into Peru, because we can
visit some of these companies

3380
03:23:47,320 --> 03:23:56,440
(Fiorella)  from chocolate, from
potatoes, and the rest of the fruits.

3381
03:23:56,440 --> 03:24:04,680
(Fiorella)  We can prepare an agenda
around the trip, but before the
Experimentaria, because the

3382
03:24:05,640 --> 03:24:08,840
(Fiorella)  Experimentaria is near to
the Madrid show, so it's near.

3383
03:24:09,480 --> 03:24:09,640
(Ysam)  Yeah.

3384
03:24:09,640 --> 03:24:09,800
(Ysam)  Yeah.

3385
03:24:09,800 --> 03:24:10,600
(Fiorella)  Before that.

3386
03:24:12,360 --> 03:24:13,400
(Akim)  Yeah, we can do that.

3387
03:24:14,200 --> 03:24:14,680
(Akim)  We can do that.

3388
03:24:15,560 --> 03:24:22,040
(Akim)  Before that, you have
understood, we need to do the brands,
set up the company, and

3389
03:24:22,040 --> 03:24:26,120
(Akim)  we have a lot of process
to do and to build the catalog.

3390
03:24:26,120 --> 03:24:28,920
(Akim)  And once we have that, of
course, we can come to Peru.

3391
03:24:28,920 --> 03:24:33,480
(Akim)  The idea is not only to
come to Peru, but also to go to Costa
Rica, to Mexico, to see

3392
03:24:33,480 --> 03:24:35,480
(Akim)  what foods we can have
over there as well.

3393
03:24:35,480 --> 03:24:37,480
(Akim)  Because the idea in Peru,
that's fine.

3394
03:24:37,480 --> 03:24:42,040
(Akim)  There is a lot of products
over there, but pineapples may be
cheaper in Costa Rica.

3395
03:24:42,600 --> 03:24:46,360
(Akim)  In Mexico, we may find
strawberries and this and that.

3396
03:24:46,360 --> 03:24:51,000
(Akim)  So we want to have
complementary offering from those
different countries, you see?

3397
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:52,600
(Akim)  And then build the
offering and sell it.

3398
03:24:53,240 --> 03:24:54,920
(Fiorella)  I have friends in Mexico.

3399
03:24:55,640 --> 03:25:00,520
(Fiorella)  These customers that I
said, it's a very good friend.

3400
03:25:00,520 --> 03:25:09,000
(Fiorella)  And also the commercial
officer from Peru in Mexico is my
friend.

3401
03:25:09,000 --> 03:25:10,360
(Fiorella)  It's my last boss.

3402
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:12,040
(Fiorella)  Okay, cool.

3403
03:25:12,040 --> 03:25:13,400
(Fiorella)  When I was young.

3404
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:17,320
(Fiorella)  So she knows about the
market, the industry, and she can help
us.

3405
03:25:18,920 --> 03:25:21,160
(Fiorella)  I have a lot of contacts
in this business.

3406
03:25:21,160 --> 03:25:21,640
(Akim)  Excellent.

3407
03:25:21,640 --> 03:25:22,200
(Akim)  Excellent.

3408
03:25:22,840 --> 03:25:23,160
(Akim)  That's good.

3409
03:25:23,160 --> 03:25:24,200
(Ysam)  That's the most important.

3410
03:25:24,280 --> 03:25:29,240
(Akim)  I think it's important to
have complementary skills because you
are there in Latin America.

3411
03:25:29,240 --> 03:25:30,680
(Akim)  We are in Europe.

3412
03:25:30,680 --> 03:25:31,800
(Akim)  We can cover Europe.

3413
03:25:31,800 --> 03:25:33,400
(Akim)  You can cover Latin
America for us.

3414
03:25:33,960 --> 03:25:35,240
(Akim)  We can cover North Africa.

3415
03:25:35,240 --> 03:25:38,520
(Akim)  We can cover Dubai and
Middle East, Russia.

3416
03:25:38,520 --> 03:25:43,320
(Fiorella)  In Dubai, I have three
friends.

3417
03:25:43,320 --> 03:25:43,820
(Akim)  Okay.

3418
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:45,960
(Akim)  What do they do over
there?

3419
03:25:46,920 --> 03:25:57,960
(Fiorella)  A three import dry foods,
quinoa, jalapenos, chia.

3420
03:26:02,280 --> 03:26:03,960
(Fiorella)  And the other one is Tex-
Mex.

3421
03:26:04,920 --> 03:26:10,840
(Fiorella)  We can offer maybe this
kind of chips from quinoa.

3422
03:26:10,840 --> 03:26:14,200
(Fiorella)  Quinoa chips that is
adding sesame or chia.

3423
03:26:14,760 --> 03:26:19,640
(Fiorella)  That is totally different
because it's in a trendy of Tex-Mex but
healthy because it's

3424
03:26:19,640 --> 03:26:20,200
(Fiorella)  a trendy.

3425
03:26:21,320 --> 03:26:31,640
(Fiorella)  It's different to eat a
nachos made by corn that made by quinoa.

3426
03:26:31,640 --> 03:26:38,440
(Fiorella)  You know that quinoa has
seven of the night of amino acid
essential for blood.

3427
03:26:39,320 --> 03:26:39,880
(Akim)  Oh, really?

3428
03:26:39,880 --> 03:26:40,380
(Akim)  Okay.

3429
03:26:41,100 --> 03:26:49,820
(Fiorella)  So, the benefits in the
long term is with quinoa, with benefits
of proteins, a lot of

3430
03:26:49,820 --> 03:26:50,320
(Akim)  that.

3431
03:26:50,860 --> 03:26:55,260
(Akim)  And something we'll
discuss with you but we'll check what
we'll be doing also is we'll be

3432
03:26:55,260 --> 03:26:57,900
(Akim)  launching an offering for
Halal food.

3433
03:26:57,900 --> 03:26:59,420
(Akim)  Do you know Halal food?

3434
03:26:59,420 --> 03:27:00,540
(Akim)  You know what Halal means?

3435
03:27:00,540 --> 03:27:01,100
(Akim)  Okay.

3436
03:27:01,100 --> 03:27:03,820
(Akim)  So, we'll be launching an
offer on that as well.

3437
03:27:05,660 --> 03:27:06,620
(Fiorella)  For dry products.

3438
03:27:07,500 --> 03:27:09,260
(Fiorella)  Agro-industrial business,
yeah?

3439
03:27:09,260 --> 03:27:10,700
(Akim)  In general, we don't care.

3440
03:27:10,700 --> 03:27:16,780
(Akim)  We will put a Halal food
offering separately from the fruits and
exotics and the vegetables,

3441
03:27:16,780 --> 03:27:17,420
(Akim)  you see?

3442
03:27:17,420 --> 03:27:22,620
(Akim)  Because if you want to
target Middle East and they have the
money, you need to put Halal

3443
03:27:22,620 --> 03:27:23,740
(Akim)  food in front of them.

3444
03:27:23,740 --> 03:27:25,980
(Fiorella)  So, share a Halal or only
Halal?

3445
03:27:27,180 --> 03:27:28,140
(Fiorella)  It's the same.

3446
03:27:28,140 --> 03:27:29,100
(Fiorella)  Yeah, it's the same.

3447
03:27:29,100 --> 03:27:29,580
(Fiorella)  It's the same.

3448
03:27:30,860 --> 03:27:31,420
(Fiorella)  Another thing.

3449
03:27:32,220 --> 03:27:33,260
(Fiorella)  I remember that I…

3450
03:27:34,380 --> 03:27:36,860
(Akim)  But you see this is a
huge, huge market, Halal food.

3451
03:27:36,860 --> 03:27:39,100
(Akim)  I can guarantee we can
make money just with Halal.

3452
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:47,580
(Fiorella)  Yeah, I work in a project
with some friends in Dubai.

3453
03:27:50,380 --> 03:27:53,660
(Fiorella)  According to the quinoa,
quinoa ready to eat.

3454
03:27:55,420 --> 03:28:00,540
(Fiorella)  It's like a cup and you
can find plenty quinoa.

3455
03:28:02,380 --> 03:28:05,580
(Fiorella)  In the top, you can find
sausages.

3456
03:28:06,220 --> 03:28:15,500
(Fiorella)  Sausages with antipasto,
with artichokes, some of the sausages.

3457
03:28:16,620 --> 03:28:21,740
(Fiorella)  I prepare it and mix it
with quinoa that is ready to eat.

3458
03:28:22,700 --> 03:28:27,980
(Fiorella)  So, I remember that you
mentioned that you work with top hotels.

3459
03:28:28,540 --> 03:28:29,040
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3460
03:28:30,380 --> 03:28:49,660
(Fiorella)  We can try to sell maybe
when the cookies close or at the bar, I
don't know, as a snack

3461
03:28:49,660 --> 03:28:52,220
(Fiorella)  to take and go because
it's another trendy.

3462
03:28:53,260 --> 03:28:53,740
(Fiorella)  Why not?

3463
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:54,540
(Akim)  Why not?

3464
03:28:54,540 --> 03:28:55,100
(Akim)  That's good.

3465
03:28:55,100 --> 03:28:55,980
(Akim)  That's good.

3466
03:28:56,220 --> 03:28:58,860
(Fiorella)  Or they can put a machine
with this kind of products.

3467
03:28:58,860 --> 03:28:59,340
(Fiorella)  I don't know.

3468
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:00,300
(Fiorella)  I am trying to…

3469
03:29:00,940 --> 03:29:01,660
(Akim)  But that's good.

3470
03:29:01,660 --> 03:29:07,180
(Akim)  Just to give you an idea,
and Issam knows that, I spend my time in
Monaco.

3471
03:29:07,180 --> 03:29:11,180
(Akim)  In Monaco, you have a lot
of five-star hotels and I know them.

3472
03:29:11,180 --> 03:29:14,220
(Akim)  So, five-star hotels in
Monaco would be one of the targets.

3473
03:29:15,580 --> 03:29:17,100
(Akim)  And there, they buy
everything.

3474
03:29:17,100 --> 03:29:18,860
(Akim)  As long as it is healthy,
they have the money.

3475
03:29:21,180 --> 03:29:25,660
(Fiorella)  This is the product that I
mentioned, quinoa ready to eat.

3476
03:29:25,740 --> 03:29:26,240
(Ysam)  Yeah.

3477
03:29:27,340 --> 03:29:28,300
(Fiorella)  For example, this.

3478
03:29:32,700 --> 03:29:33,740
(Akim)  Quinoa ready to eat?

3479
03:29:34,700 --> 03:29:35,340
(Ysam)  Nice package.

3480
03:29:36,460 --> 03:29:37,740
(Ysam)  Is it something you can
have?

3481
03:29:38,940 --> 03:29:40,220
(Fiorella)  Here in Peru, they
produce.

3482
03:29:41,100 --> 03:29:41,600
(Fiorella)  That?

3483
03:29:42,220 --> 03:29:42,720
(Fiorella)  Yes.

3484
03:29:43,340 --> 03:29:44,940
(Akim)  But do you know if it is…

3485
03:29:47,180 --> 03:29:51,660
(Akim)  If you want to sell that,
let's say, in the Middle East, is it
kind of halal or do you

3486
03:29:51,660 --> 03:29:52,780
(Akim)  know that or not?

3487
03:29:52,780 --> 03:29:54,220
(Fiorella)  They have kosher and
halal.

3488
03:29:59,740 --> 03:30:05,900
(Fiorella)  The particular thing in
this project that I participate is that
I am created

3489
03:30:07,100 --> 03:30:14,620
(Fiorella)  on a special receipt from
Monaco, from Gul, for the part of the
Middle East.

3490
03:30:15,420 --> 03:30:18,540
(Fiorella)  Because, you know, in
Middle East, it's not typical to eat…

3491
03:30:20,620 --> 03:30:21,180
(Fiorella)  What is that?

3492
03:30:21,180 --> 03:30:22,460
(Fiorella)  Artichoke pasta.

3493
03:30:22,540 --> 03:30:23,040
(Ysam)  Yeah.

3494
03:30:24,380 --> 03:30:30,700
(Fiorella)  I prepare a special
receipt for this kind of market.

3495
03:30:31,580 --> 03:30:34,300
(Fiorella)  This project is in
standby.

3496
03:30:34,860 --> 03:30:36,620
(Fiorella)  I know the contact of the
person.

3497
03:30:36,620 --> 03:30:39,900
(Fiorella)  I know the prices, but we
need to update the prices.

3498
03:30:42,460 --> 03:30:47,420
(Fiorella)  I have all about the
receipt because I create six receipts.

3499
03:30:48,220 --> 03:30:53,660
(Akim)  You created six receipts
of that, of quinoa to eat.

3500
03:30:53,660 --> 03:30:54,160
(Akim)  Okay.

3501
03:30:54,780 --> 03:30:58,300
(Fiorella)  Of quinoa, but accordingly
to the market for the Middle East.

3502
03:30:58,300 --> 03:30:59,100
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah.

3503
03:30:59,100 --> 03:31:00,060
(Akim)  For the Middle East.

3504
03:31:00,060 --> 03:31:01,900
(Akim)  And what was the taste of
the Middle East?

3505
03:31:01,900 --> 03:31:02,620
(Akim)  What did they want?

3506
03:31:05,820 --> 03:31:11,820
(Fiorella)  I created quinoa Moroccan,
quinoa pesto, quinoa piquillo, quinoa
artichoke.

3507
03:31:13,100 --> 03:31:14,780
(Akim)  Can you share your screen
like that, Lucy?

3508
03:31:17,420 --> 03:31:18,220
(Akim)  Quinoa Moroccan?

3509
03:31:19,340 --> 03:31:20,860
(Ysam)  Well, maybe taste, yeah.

3510
03:31:21,580 --> 03:31:22,540
(Ysam)  It's very nice, yeah.

3511
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:25,260
(Fiorella)  And also, I am creating…

3512
03:31:25,260 --> 03:31:26,700
(Akim)  By the way, we are not
Moroccan.

3513
03:31:28,060 --> 03:31:32,540
(Fiorella)  And also, I am creating
the label.

3514
03:31:33,260 --> 03:31:35,820
(Akim)  Hey, Sam, I'm sure we're
going to have fun in this business, my
friend.

3515
03:31:35,820 --> 03:31:36,940
(Ysam)  Ah, it's beautiful.

3516
03:31:36,940 --> 03:31:39,020
(Ysam)  You have quinoa with
Moroccan taste?

3517
03:31:39,020 --> 03:31:40,540
(Akim)  Yes, yes, it's normal.

3518
03:31:40,540 --> 03:31:41,040
(Akim)  Perfect.

3519
03:31:41,040 --> 03:31:41,900
(Akim)  Quinoa Moroccan.

3520
03:31:41,900 --> 03:31:42,460
(Akim)  What do you want more?

3521
03:31:42,460 --> 03:31:42,960
(Akim)  Why not?

3522
03:31:43,920 --> 03:31:47,760
(Fiorella)  This is the label that I
created with the Creative Studio.

3523
03:31:48,480 --> 03:31:49,920
(Akim)  Amazonia Kitchen.

3524
03:31:49,920 --> 03:31:50,960
(Ysam)  I like the brand.

3525
03:31:50,960 --> 03:31:51,680
(Ysam)  That's good.

3526
03:31:51,680 --> 03:31:54,080
(Ysam)  In addition, with Arabic
writing and everything.

3527
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:54,580
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3528
03:31:56,880 --> 03:32:01,440
(Fiorella)  This is my creation
because I created all the labels with
the Creative Studio.

3529
03:32:03,760 --> 03:32:05,680
(Akim)  Look, look, Fiorella.

3530
03:32:05,680 --> 03:32:07,760
(Akim)  We want that product and
we want to sell it

3531
03:32:08,320 --> 03:32:12,080
(Akim)  because I guarantee that
this one could be sold everywhere in the
Arab world.

3532
03:32:13,040 --> 03:32:13,760
(Ysam)  A nice brand.

3533
03:32:13,760 --> 03:32:14,480
(Ysam)  I thought…

3534
03:32:14,480 --> 03:32:15,520
(Ysam)  Amazonia Kitchen.

3535
03:32:15,520 --> 03:32:16,960
(Ysam)  AmazoniaKitchen.com.

3536
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:17,520
(Ysam)  Magnifique.

3537
03:32:17,520 --> 03:32:18,720
(Akim)  Look if it's referenced.

3538
03:32:18,720 --> 03:32:19,220
(Akim)  Yeah.

3539
03:32:21,440 --> 03:32:22,320
(Akim)  Magnifique.

3540
03:32:22,320 --> 03:32:24,560
(Akim)  With Moroccan vegetable
style.

3541
03:32:24,560 --> 03:32:25,060
(Akim)  Okay.

3542
03:32:25,920 --> 03:32:26,480
(Akim)  I like it.

3543
03:32:26,480 --> 03:32:29,840
(Fiorella)  I prepared all for this
project.

3544
03:32:29,840 --> 03:32:32,160
(Fiorella)  I put my heart, all of
that.

3545
03:32:32,720 --> 03:32:33,840
(Fiorella)  But it is in standby.

3546
03:32:34,800 --> 03:32:35,360
(Akim)  Okay, okay.

3547
03:32:36,640 --> 03:32:38,400
(Akim)  Put that product,
Fiorella.

3548
03:32:38,480 --> 03:32:44,720
(Fiorella)  We cannot take this label
because it's a creation and this is for
my friend.

3549
03:32:44,720 --> 03:32:45,840
(Fiorella)  So I can take it.

3550
03:32:45,840 --> 03:32:47,280
(Fiorella)  And the name is also for
him.

3551
03:32:48,400 --> 03:32:54,080
(Fiorella)  But the receipt and the
producer and the contact I have here in
Peru.

3552
03:32:54,720 --> 03:33:02,240
(Fiorella)  So we can do it a mix of
container for this kind of product and
with the special receipts.

3553
03:33:02,240 --> 03:33:05,920
(Akim)  But can you go back a few
seconds on the product?

3554
03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:07,920
(Akim)  Where is it written that
it is halal?

3555
03:33:07,920 --> 03:33:09,040
(Akim)  Where is it written?

3556
03:33:09,040 --> 03:33:10,080
(Akim)  Have you put it somewhere?

3557
03:33:11,920 --> 03:33:12,720
(Fiorella)  No, let me check.

3558
03:33:12,720 --> 03:33:15,520
(Fiorella)  Yeah, we can put it
because it's very important for this
market.

3559
03:33:15,520 --> 03:33:16,560
(Fiorella)  Of course, of course.

3560
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:18,240
(Fiorella)  Let me see.

3561
03:33:18,240 --> 03:33:18,880
(Fiorella)  How is it?

3562
03:33:18,880 --> 03:33:23,280
(Ysam)  Even if it's writing in
Arabic, it's nice and it's put just
halal in there.

3563
03:33:24,480 --> 03:33:26,720
(Akim)  Because if it's not halal,
they will not buy it.

3564
03:33:26,720 --> 03:33:27,280
(Akim)  They don't care.

3565
03:33:27,280 --> 03:33:28,480
(Fiorella)  No, it's halal.

3566
03:33:28,480 --> 03:33:30,880
(Fiorella)  Yeah, because they have a
kosher and…

3567
03:33:30,880 --> 03:33:33,040
(Fiorella)  I don't know if it's
halal, but it's kosher.

3568
03:33:33,040 --> 03:33:39,040
(Fiorella)  Because they need to
inspect for the…

3569
03:33:41,120 --> 03:33:42,880
(Ysam)  Yeah, kosher is the same,
similar, yeah.

3570
03:33:43,680 --> 03:33:44,320
(Fiorella)  What is it?

3571
03:33:45,840 --> 03:33:47,120
(Ysam)  I think it's frozen now.

3572
03:33:47,120 --> 03:33:48,080
(Ysam)  I didn't see nothing.

3573
03:33:53,280 --> 03:33:54,080
(Ysam)  Moroccan taste.

3574
03:33:57,280 --> 03:33:58,080
(Akim)  Have you tried it?

3575
03:33:58,080 --> 03:34:00,080
(Akim)  I mean, have you tasted
this product?

3576
03:34:00,080 --> 03:34:00,560
(Akim)  Is it good?

3577
03:34:03,360 --> 03:34:04,880
(Fiorella)  Yeah, pesto is good.

3578
03:34:05,520 --> 03:34:06,320
(Fiorella)  Oh, pesto.

3579
03:34:06,320 --> 03:34:07,600
(Fiorella)  Moroccan and Pekin.

3580
03:34:07,600 --> 03:34:08,960
(Fiorella)  There are six recipes.

3581
03:34:12,080 --> 03:34:12,580
(Ysam)  Nice.

3582
03:34:14,240 --> 03:34:15,440
(Akim)  We can sell it.

3583
03:34:15,440 --> 03:34:15,840
(Akim)  I have…

3584
03:34:16,960 --> 03:34:20,080
(Akim)  Istam knows that, but we
have collections everywhere in the Arab
world.

3585
03:34:20,080 --> 03:34:21,680
(Akim)  So, this is easy to sell
for us.

3586
03:34:22,320 --> 03:34:23,840
(Ysam)  Especially this kind of
products, yeah.

3587
03:34:23,840 --> 03:34:24,340
(Ysam)  Yeah.

3588
03:34:24,960 --> 03:34:28,080
(Fiorella)  I create this kind of
colors and all of that.

3589
03:34:28,080 --> 03:34:29,360
(Akim)  Can you put it bigger?

3590
03:34:29,360 --> 03:34:30,400
(Akim)  We don't see it right now.

3591
03:34:30,880 --> 03:34:38,320
(Fiorella)  I strongly suggest that we
need to create these labels and also the
logo for a special…

3592
03:34:39,360 --> 03:34:40,800
(Fiorella)  With a special…

3593
03:34:40,800 --> 03:34:42,080
(Fiorella)  I like the idea, yeah.

3594
03:34:42,080 --> 03:34:49,360
(Fiorella)  Professional, because they
want to put and consider the logo and
the colors and all of

3595
03:34:49,360 --> 03:34:51,280
(Fiorella)  that in a brand book and
we can use it.

3596
03:34:52,080 --> 03:34:52,720
(Fiorella)  That's fine.

3597
03:34:52,720 --> 03:34:54,800
(Akim)  It's very important to
invest in this thing.

3598
03:34:55,360 --> 03:34:55,840
(Fiorella)  Yeah, yeah.

3599
03:34:55,840 --> 03:34:56,400
(Fiorella)  We have…

3600
03:34:56,400 --> 03:34:59,200
(Akim)  You will see it in the
future, but Christophe is the
professional.

3601
03:34:59,280 --> 03:35:04,320
(Akim)  He's doing everything here
on the design things, IT things, and he
will manage it.

3602
03:35:04,320 --> 03:35:05,120
(Akim)  Okay, excellent.

3603
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:05,620
(Akim)  But this is a…

3604
03:35:06,320 --> 03:35:09,600
(Fiorella)  He's a professional in
this part, but they don't…

3605
03:35:10,160 --> 03:35:13,680
(Fiorella)  I think they don't have
experience in agribusiness products.

3606
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:18,320
(Akim)  We have experience in
business.

3607
03:35:19,440 --> 03:35:21,760
(Akim)  We've done export also in
the past.

3608
03:35:21,760 --> 03:35:24,240
(Akim)  We've got experience in IT
business.

3609
03:35:25,040 --> 03:35:27,520
(Akim)  And yeah, agribusiness.

3610
03:35:27,520 --> 03:35:28,080
(Akim)  It's not…

3611
03:35:29,120 --> 03:35:33,120
(Akim)  We have experience in
agribusiness, but it's a different type
of agribusiness we've been

3612
03:35:33,120 --> 03:35:33,920
(Akim)  doing in the past.

3613
03:35:33,920 --> 03:35:35,040
(Akim)  It's a different one.

3614
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:36,560
(Akim)  We've been working in…

3615
03:35:36,560 --> 03:35:42,000
(Akim)  For instance, we've been
working in exporting bikes, you know,
bikes, from Asia to Auchan,

3616
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:43,840
(Akim)  to Carrefour, and so on,
in the past.

3617
03:35:43,840 --> 03:35:45,520
(Akim)  So, it's a different type
of business.

3618
03:35:45,520 --> 03:35:50,720
(Akim)  And we've done at some
point very minimal, but we've done
grapes and we've done tomatoes

3619
03:35:50,720 --> 03:35:55,920
(Akim)  and potatoes, but mostly
here in Europe, you know, between France
and Canada.

3620
03:35:55,920 --> 03:35:56,960
(Akim)  And Germany, and so on.

3621
03:35:56,960 --> 03:35:58,160
(Akim)  So, we are aware.

3622
03:35:59,200 --> 03:36:01,280
(Akim)  But Peru, it's totally
different.

3623
03:36:01,280 --> 03:36:04,080
(Akim)  It's a different set up,
you know.

3624
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:07,520
(Akim)  But Halal food, it's
completely different as well.

3625
03:36:07,520 --> 03:36:08,960
(Akim)  You see, it's a different
area as well.

3626
03:36:09,760 --> 03:36:13,520
(Akim)  But if you have this type
of products, I'm pretty sure it could be
successful.

3627
03:36:15,040 --> 03:36:15,540
(Akim)  Yes.

3628
03:36:16,720 --> 03:36:18,080
(Fiorella)  You've done the recipe
yourself.

3629
03:36:21,520 --> 03:36:22,960
I prepared this recipe with…

3630
03:36:23,920 --> 03:36:27,600
(Fiorella)  I prepared this recipe
with our friend, one friend that I…

3631
03:36:27,600 --> 03:36:30,160
(Fiorella)  that he lives now in
Spain, I think, in Madrid.

3632
03:36:31,440 --> 03:36:38,480
(Fiorella)  He's a doctor in
gastronomy, and he was of directors of
the All Hotels for Five Stars,

3633
03:36:39,200 --> 03:36:41,920
(Fiorella)  from the channel of
Hilton, maybe?

3634
03:36:41,920 --> 03:36:43,360
(Fiorella)  Or Marriott, I don't
remember.

3635
03:36:44,480 --> 03:36:49,680
(Fiorella)  And he has experience in
all of… about the culinary.

3636
03:36:50,960 --> 03:36:51,460
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3637
03:36:53,840 --> 03:36:54,400
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3638
03:36:54,400 --> 03:36:57,360
(Fiorella)  So, this is… this project
is in standby.

3639
03:36:58,960 --> 03:37:00,160
(Fiorella)  There are two…

3640
03:37:01,120 --> 03:37:02,400
(Akim)  Tell him… you know what?

3641
03:37:02,400 --> 03:37:06,480
(Akim)  Tell him if he… if you
want to reactivate this project, we can
do that.

3642
03:37:08,720 --> 03:37:15,200
(Fiorella)  No, we can take it,
because the producer of these products
is here in Peru.

3643
03:37:15,200 --> 03:37:15,700
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3644
03:37:15,700 --> 03:37:16,560
(Fiorella)  And I have the contact.

3645
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:18,960
(Akim)  Yeah, but I mean the brand
and so on.

3646
03:37:19,760 --> 03:37:20,400
(Akim)  No, the brand is for…

3647
03:37:20,400 --> 03:37:21,200
(Akim)  The packaging.

3648
03:37:21,200 --> 03:37:22,240
(Akim)  Yeah, you see.

3649
03:37:22,240 --> 03:37:26,320
(Fiorella)  The brand is for him, and
the label is for him, but we can create
another.

3650
03:37:26,320 --> 03:37:26,880
(Fiorella)  So, no problem.

3651
03:37:26,880 --> 03:37:27,360
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3652
03:37:27,360 --> 03:37:28,240
(Akim)  Yeah, that's not an issue.

3653
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:28,560
(Akim)  Okay.

3654
03:37:28,560 --> 03:37:31,840
(Fiorella)  We can create another
label with this kind of studio.

3655
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:41,360
(Fiorella)  And another brand
different than Amazonia, because I give
you the name.

3656
03:37:41,360 --> 03:37:42,800
(Fiorella)  I give him the name.

3657
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:43,440
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah.

3658
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:44,240
(Akim)  No risk, no risk.

3659
03:37:44,640 --> 03:37:48,400
(Fiorella)  But we can continue with
this business, because he's now in…

3660
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:54,080
(Fiorella)  opening a succursal in
Europe from the Tex-Mex products.

3661
03:37:54,640 --> 03:37:55,280
(Fiorella)  Tex-Mex?

3662
03:37:55,280 --> 03:37:56,080
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3663
03:37:56,080 --> 03:37:56,640
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3664
03:37:56,640 --> 03:38:06,160
(Fiorella)  She is the nachos,
peppers, jalapenos, roasted peppers,
mushrooms with jalapenos.

3665
03:38:06,160 --> 03:38:09,600
(Fiorella)  All about Mexican foods.

3666
03:38:09,600 --> 03:38:10,100
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3667
03:38:11,120 --> 03:38:11,620
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3668
03:38:12,180 --> 03:38:12,980
(Fiorella)  That's it.

3669
03:38:12,980 --> 03:38:19,940
(Fiorella)  So, we can develop this
business with another label, another
brand, and we can do it.

3670
03:38:20,660 --> 03:38:21,160
(Akim)  Yeah.

3671
03:38:21,780 --> 03:38:26,020
(Akim)  What will be also
important, Ferreira, is think about
snacking, you know, fast food,

3672
03:38:26,020 --> 03:38:26,980
(Akim)  snacking.

3673
03:38:26,980 --> 03:38:32,500
(Akim)  If you have Peruvian foods
for snacking, that's important, because
people more and

3674
03:38:32,500 --> 03:38:33,620
(Akim)  more want snacking.

3675
03:38:33,620 --> 03:38:34,420
(Akim)  You see what I mean?

3676
03:38:34,420 --> 03:38:35,140
(Akim)  They don't have time.

3677
03:38:35,140 --> 03:38:36,420
(Akim)  They want snacking, to
snack.

3678
03:38:38,020 --> 03:38:38,520
(Akim)  So…

3679
03:38:38,840 --> 03:38:44,760
(Fiorella)  This product, quinoa, is
very interesting, because it's take-and-
go.

3680
03:38:44,760 --> 03:38:45,880
(Akim)  Yeah, take-and-go,
exactly.

3681
03:38:45,880 --> 03:38:52,520
(Fiorella)  You can eat fresh or hot
or cold.

3682
03:38:52,520 --> 03:38:53,240
(Ysam)  Yeah.

3683
03:38:53,240 --> 03:38:53,740
(Fiorella)  It depends.

3684
03:38:54,360 --> 03:39:01,080
(Fiorella)  And it's very easy,
because you can open, put in the sauce
instead with the quinoa,

3685
03:39:01,640 --> 03:39:02,140
(Fiorella)  and mix.

3686
03:39:02,700 --> 03:39:08,860
(Fiorella)  And it's very healthy,
because the trend is healthy snacking,
take-and-go.

3687
03:39:09,980 --> 03:39:17,660
(Fiorella)  And also, the other part
of this business, we can sell it,
snacking with quinoa, quinoa

3688
03:39:17,660 --> 03:39:20,380
(Fiorella)  bars, or with Andean mixes
of bars.

3689
03:39:22,140 --> 03:39:28,540
(Fiorella)  The other snack that we
have are chips, and potato chips with
native potatoes, native

3690
03:39:28,540 --> 03:39:31,500
(Fiorella)  potatoes with carrot and
beetroot.

3691
03:39:32,700 --> 03:39:34,540
(Fiorella)  This is the range of
snacking.

3692
03:39:34,540 --> 03:39:37,340
(Fiorella)  We have five products, so
I think it's very good.

3693
03:39:37,340 --> 03:39:39,020
(Fiorella)  And also, chocolate.

3694
03:39:39,020 --> 03:39:39,980
(Akim)  No, it's good.

3695
03:39:39,980 --> 03:39:45,580
(Akim)  And do you know, this
company, this design company called
Creative Studio, how much

3696
03:39:45,580 --> 03:39:47,420
(Akim)  does it cost to create a
brand with them?

3697
03:39:51,420 --> 03:39:55,500
(Akim)  Like that, you created
this one, Amazonian Kitchen, but how
much does it cost to create

3698
03:39:55,500 --> 03:39:56,000
(Akim)  one?

3699
03:39:56,560 --> 03:39:59,760
(Fiorella)  No, I am creating the
labels.

3700
03:39:59,760 --> 03:40:00,480
(Ysam)  Yeah, the labels.

3701
03:40:01,280 --> 03:40:03,120
(Fiorella)  The Amazonian Kitchen is
my idea.

3702
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:06,080
(Fiorella)  And the logo is for my
friend.

3703
03:40:06,640 --> 03:40:10,640
(Akim)  Okay, but let's say we
want to do something similar with
Creative Studio.

3704
03:40:10,640 --> 03:40:11,520
(Akim)  How much does it cost?

3705
03:40:12,160 --> 03:40:13,360
(Fiorella)  Let me check this card.

3706
03:40:13,360 --> 03:40:13,860
(Fiorella)  How much?

3707
03:40:14,560 --> 03:40:16,000
(Akim)  What do you think, Sam?

3708
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:18,160
(Ysam)  Yeah, that's a good
question.

3709
03:40:18,160 --> 03:40:19,280
(Ysam)  You think so?

3710
03:40:19,280 --> 03:40:19,780
(Ysam)  Yeah.

3711
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:31,120
(Fiorella)  Paypal transaction.

3712
03:40:36,640 --> 03:40:38,640
(Fiorella)  It's around $150.

3713
03:40:42,880 --> 03:40:44,240
(Akim)  $150, okay.

3714
03:40:44,240 --> 03:40:44,740
(Akim)  Dollars.

3715
03:40:45,360 --> 03:40:45,860
(Akim)  $150?

3716
03:40:48,400 --> 03:40:50,400
(Akim)  Okay, for one brand?

3717
03:40:53,520 --> 03:40:55,920
(Fiorella)  For one brand.

3718
03:40:56,720 --> 03:40:57,220
(Fiorella)  Okay.

3719
03:40:57,680 --> 03:40:58,880
(Fiorella)  See, one brand, yeah.

3720
03:41:00,960 --> 03:41:03,360
(Ysam)  So, that's with Creative
Studio, yeah.

3721
03:41:03,360 --> 03:41:07,040
(Fiorella)  This price is for the two
years ago.

3722
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:09,520
(Fiorella)  I don't know if it's the
same.

3723
03:41:09,520 --> 03:41:23,840
(Fiorella)  I need to code with
Creative Studio to prepare a brand book
for if it's one brand or we work

3724
03:41:23,840 --> 03:41:25,360
(Fiorella)  with more than one.

3725
03:41:25,360 --> 03:41:30,400
(Fiorella)  Because it's not the same
to negotiate only once, that three or
four.

3726
03:41:30,960 --> 03:41:33,520
(Fiorella)  Because as you mentioned,
we have more than one.

3727
03:41:33,520 --> 03:41:34,000
(Akim)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3728
03:41:34,000 --> 03:41:40,640
(Akim)  But of course, but the
thing is that we want to start with one
to check the quality and

3729
03:41:40,640 --> 03:41:42,640
(Akim)  to make sure everything is
in place, you see.

3730
03:41:42,640 --> 03:41:46,880
(Akim)  So, we can start with one
and then grow to four or six in the
future.

3731
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:52,400
(Akim)  But for the moment, if we
take the example of this one, not
Amazonian Kitchen, but another

3732
03:41:52,400 --> 03:41:58,080
(Akim)  one, this brand, it will
cost, ask them, how much will it cost if
tomorrow you want

3733
03:41:58,080 --> 03:42:02,560
(Akim)  to launch another
Amazonian Kitchen, not the same, but
another one, how much will it cost?

3734
03:42:02,560 --> 03:42:03,680
(Akim)  They will say $150.

3735
03:42:04,240 --> 03:42:05,360
(Akim)  Okay, that's fine.

3736
03:42:05,360 --> 03:42:08,800
(Akim)  But you see, we need to
have a basis of price.

3737
03:42:08,800 --> 03:42:11,040
(Akim)  And then, of course, we
can add more brands.

3738
03:42:11,040 --> 03:42:12,720
(Akim)  And this is the future.

3739
03:42:12,720 --> 03:42:18,000
(Akim)  But we need to know the
price against one brand for the
beginning.

3740
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:21,040
(Akim)  So, if you say $150, that
makes sense.

3741
03:42:21,040 --> 03:42:21,760
(Akim)  Okay.

3742
03:42:22,320 --> 03:42:22,960
(Akim)  Where are they based?

3743
03:42:22,960 --> 03:42:23,680
(Akim)  They are in Lima?

3744
03:42:24,800 --> 03:42:25,300
(Fiorella)  In Lima.

3745
03:42:26,560 --> 03:42:32,960
(Fiorella)  She or he can create a
brand accordingly to the international
market.

3746
03:42:32,960 --> 03:42:35,520
(Fiorella)  They have experience in
big companies.

3747
03:42:36,880 --> 03:42:45,920
(Fiorella)  Also, they give you a
brand book, as I showed one hour ago.

3748
03:42:46,880 --> 03:42:55,680
(Fiorella)  They prepare a brand book
with all the logo, with the fonts, with
merchandise, and with

3749
03:42:58,160 --> 03:42:59,840
(Fiorella)  photos in high definition.

3750
03:43:00,800 --> 03:43:02,000
(Fiorella)  And logo also.

3751
03:43:02,000 --> 03:43:09,600
(Fiorella)  You can use, because they
instruct us how we can use, how is the
colors according to

3752
03:43:09,600 --> 03:43:16,720
(Fiorella)  the pattern, and the
measures, and the varieties, and we can
do it.

3753
03:43:17,600 --> 03:43:22,800
(Fiorella)  If we can use white,
black, or tones that we can use.

3754
03:43:22,800 --> 03:43:25,920
(Fiorella)  So, this is very important
to have a brand book.

3755
03:43:26,560 --> 03:43:27,440
(Akim)  That's true, that's true.

3756
03:43:27,440 --> 03:43:33,040
(Akim)  But I think it's
interesting if they do this type of
pricing and you have several brands,

3757
03:43:33,040 --> 03:43:34,800
(Akim)  that would be interesting
to work with them.

3758
03:43:34,800 --> 03:43:35,360
(Akim)  Okay.

3759
03:43:35,360 --> 03:43:39,680
(Akim)  But, you know, we can
start, I'll discuss that with this time,
but we can start with

3760
03:43:39,680 --> 03:43:47,200
(Akim)  the equivalent or the
counterpart of Amazonia Kitchen to see
if they can do something.

3761
03:43:47,200 --> 03:43:49,360
(Akim)  Ask them if you can do
something around that.

3762
03:43:49,360 --> 03:43:52,880
(Akim)  Because I've seen in the
packaging, they have put Arabic on it
and so on.

3763
03:43:52,880 --> 03:43:54,000
(Akim)  I like that.

3764
03:43:54,000 --> 03:44:00,240
(Akim)  But yeah, basically, if
you can replace Amazonia Kitchen by
something else that they decide,

3765
03:44:01,040 --> 03:44:04,640
(Akim)  let's see, and we pay for
that, it's not an issue.

3766
03:44:05,280 --> 03:44:08,800
(Akim)  But that will be our own
brand, not Amazonia Kitchen.

3767
03:44:10,480 --> 03:44:11,920
(Fiorella)  No, yeah, yeah, I know it.

3768
03:44:12,640 --> 03:44:19,920
(Fiorella)  We work according to
international market because we need to
check which company is

3769
03:44:19,920 --> 03:44:26,080
(Fiorella)  our competitive and which
is the logo of this company and how we
can do the difference with

3770
03:44:26,080 --> 03:44:26,960
(Fiorella)  those companies.

3771
03:44:28,080 --> 03:44:33,520
(Fiorella)  Because it's a high
quality, it's our difference, we are
competitors.

3772
03:44:33,520 --> 03:44:34,560
(Fiorella)  What is the attendance?

3773
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:36,080
(Fiorella)  What is the colors?

3774
03:44:36,080 --> 03:44:47,440
(Fiorella)  Because according to the
apparel or clothing, we know that in
agribusiness, there are some

3775
03:44:47,440 --> 03:44:54,320
(Fiorella)  trendings, there are some
colors in a packaging, there are some
tendons that we can use.

3776
03:44:54,320 --> 03:45:00,800
(Fiorella)  The tendons are clean with
colors, yeah, but we reduce the

3777
03:45:05,360 --> 03:45:11,120
(Fiorella)  in the label, reduce the
additives that you can use it.

3778
03:45:12,400 --> 03:45:20,880
(Fiorella)  So, it's very important to
consider that trend in terms of leveling
and in terms of agribusiness.

3779
03:45:21,840 --> 03:45:26,160
(Akim)  Yeah, okay, makes sense.

3780
03:45:28,800 --> 03:45:33,840
(Akim)  Good, and do you think
this type of product could be, let's
say, if we have everything

3781
03:45:33,840 --> 03:45:38,160
(Akim)  done and so on, what would
be the best event for this product?

3782
03:45:38,160 --> 03:45:39,920
(Akim)  It would be WAP or World
Food?

3783
03:45:44,880 --> 03:45:49,200
(Fiorella)  I don't participate in
WAP, but in World Food, yeah.

3784
03:45:49,200 --> 03:45:56,000
(Fiorella)  Every year, World Food has
more visitors and more participant
exhibitors, so I think

3785
03:45:56,000 --> 03:45:57,760
(Fiorella)  World Food is one of the…

3786
03:45:57,760 --> 03:45:58,640
(Fiorella)  It's good, okay.

3787
03:45:59,760 --> 03:46:01,600
(Fiorella)  It's one of the good…

3788
03:46:03,440 --> 03:46:04,400
(Fiorella)  I don't know, WAP.

3789
03:46:05,280 --> 03:46:13,840
(Fiorella)  Maybe instead of we have a
booth, we can just walk and visit, yeah.

3790
03:46:13,840 --> 03:46:14,800
(Akim)  Yeah, I see.

3791
03:46:14,800 --> 03:46:15,360
(Akim)  Makes sense.

3792
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:16,500
(Akim)  Okay.

3793
03:46:17,060 --> 03:46:18,100
Okay, okay, Fiorella.

3794
03:46:18,100 --> 03:46:19,300
(Akim)  Thank you a lot.

3795
03:46:19,300 --> 03:46:21,060
(Akim)  Any questions, Issam, on
your side?

3796
03:46:22,580 --> 03:46:26,420
(Ysam)  I don't think we will
continue the question there, you know,
then, you know.

3797
03:46:26,420 --> 03:46:27,460
(Ysam)  I think it's…

3798
03:46:27,460 --> 03:46:30,580
(Ysam)  I think thanks a lot,
Fiorella, for this talk today.

3799
03:46:31,220 --> 03:46:33,140
(Ysam)  It was very efficient, I
know.

3800
03:46:34,260 --> 03:46:39,940
(Akim)  You see, Fiorella, we are
at the beginning of creating something
big, and the idea here

3801
03:46:39,940 --> 03:46:42,660
(Akim)  is not to rely on one
market and one country only.

3802
03:46:42,740 --> 03:46:47,540
(Akim)  We really want to target
several markets and several products in
several countries.

3803
03:46:47,540 --> 03:46:48,660
(Akim)  That's the idea.

3804
03:46:48,660 --> 03:46:53,460
(Akim)  The foundation will be,
and the company will be set up in
Rotterdam, and then we can scale,

3805
03:46:53,460 --> 03:46:54,020
(Akim)  basically.

3806
03:46:54,020 --> 03:46:54,820
(Akim)  And why Rotterdam?

3807
03:46:54,820 --> 03:46:59,220
(Akim)  Because there are
exclusive agreements and arrangements
between Peru and Rotterdam.

3808
03:46:59,220 --> 03:47:04,260
(Akim)  We start with that, but
there is the same type of agreements
between Morocco and Rotterdam,

3809
03:47:04,260 --> 03:47:06,340
(Akim)  between Egypt and
Rotterdam, and so on.

3810
03:47:06,340 --> 03:47:08,260
(Akim)  So, we are there for a
reason.

3811
03:47:09,060 --> 03:47:12,020
(Akim)  And then, of course, in
Middle East, we have different
connections over there.

3812
03:47:12,020 --> 03:47:15,300
(Akim)  We can go to Qatar, to
Saudi Arabia, to Dubai.

3813
03:47:15,940 --> 03:47:17,940
(Akim)  There are a lot of
companies there that could be
interested.

3814
03:47:17,940 --> 03:47:21,860
(Fiorella)  No, Saudi Arabia is a good
and huge market.

3815
03:47:21,860 --> 03:47:22,900
(Akim)  Exactly, exactly.

3816
03:47:22,900 --> 03:47:24,420
(Fiorella)  They pay for the products.

3817
03:47:24,420 --> 03:47:26,420
(Fiorella)  Oman, Saudi Arabia.

3818
03:47:26,420 --> 03:47:27,540
(Fiorella)  Yeah, yeah.

3819
03:47:27,540 --> 03:47:28,260
(Fiorella)  They are not good…

3820
03:47:28,260 --> 03:47:33,540
(Fiorella)  For this reason, it's very
important to participate and vote next
week, next month,

3821
03:47:33,540 --> 03:47:35,220
(Fiorella)  next year, month, week.

3822
03:47:35,220 --> 03:47:36,420
(Akim)  Yeah, you're right.

3823
03:47:37,060 --> 03:47:40,100
(Akim)  The problem with those
countries is that they are not good
payers.

3824
03:47:40,100 --> 03:47:43,700
(Akim)  They have, they pay, but
they are not good payers because they
take time to pay you.

3825
03:47:43,700 --> 03:47:44,180
(Akim)  You see?

3826
03:47:44,180 --> 03:47:45,220
(Akim)  But at the end, it's okay.

3827
03:47:45,860 --> 03:47:46,500
(Akim)  Big markets.

3828
03:47:47,380 --> 03:47:48,020
(Akim)  Right, Hissam?

3829
03:47:48,580 --> 03:47:48,900
(Ysam)  Yeah.

3830
03:47:48,900 --> 03:47:49,620
(Ysam)  Sometimes, it's not…

3831
03:47:50,660 --> 03:47:52,820
(Ysam)  They are not very hurry to
pay at time, you know?

3832
03:47:52,820 --> 03:47:55,540
(Akim)  Yeah, because they have
the money, they do not hurry to pay you.

3833
03:47:55,540 --> 03:47:56,260
(Ysam)  You know?

3834
03:47:56,260 --> 03:47:57,380
(Ysam)  They don't care.

3835
03:47:57,380 --> 03:48:02,740
(Ysam)  Sometimes, you ask them to
pay, they ask you to send more.

3836
03:48:06,740 --> 03:48:07,620
(Akim)  Okay, cool.

3837
03:48:07,620 --> 03:48:08,420
(Akim)  Thank you, Fiorella.

3838
03:48:08,420 --> 03:48:14,660
(Akim)  I'll ask Christophe to set
up a one-to-one with him and then also
to set up a call with

3839
03:48:14,660 --> 03:48:15,700
(Akim)  us for the follow-up.

3840
03:48:16,420 --> 03:48:16,820
(Akim)  Okay?

3841
03:48:16,820 --> 03:48:18,420
(Akim)  Probably, end of next
week.

3842
03:48:18,420 --> 03:48:20,740
(Fiorella)  And send me the proposal
for…

3843
03:48:20,740 --> 03:48:21,460
(Fiorella)  Of course, of course.

3844
03:48:21,460 --> 03:48:23,300
(Akim)  To check in.

3845
03:48:23,300 --> 03:48:24,100
(Akim)  To check in, yeah.

3846
03:48:24,100 --> 03:48:25,380
(Fiorella)  But under some conditions.

3847
03:48:26,180 --> 03:48:26,740
(Ysam)  Makes sense.

3848
03:48:26,740 --> 03:48:28,660
(Fiorella)  Very nice to see you,
Hissam.

3849
03:48:28,660 --> 03:48:30,340
(Ysam)  Nice to see you too, yeah.

3850
03:48:30,340 --> 03:48:30,660
(Fiorella)  Yeah.

3851
03:48:30,660 --> 03:48:33,780
(Fiorella)  Nice to meet you with
Akim.

3852
03:48:33,780 --> 03:48:34,420
(Akim)  Yeah, it's Akim.

3853
03:48:34,420 --> 03:48:34,740
(Akim)  Akim.

3854
03:48:34,740 --> 03:48:36,100
(Akim)  Yeah, Akim.

3855
03:48:36,100 --> 03:48:36,340
Yeah.

3856
03:48:37,300 --> 03:48:38,500
(Akim)  Sounds good, Fiorella.

3857
03:48:38,500 --> 03:48:38,980
(Akim)  Take care.

3858
03:48:38,980 --> 03:48:39,540
(Ysam)  Okay.

3859
03:48:39,540 --> 03:48:40,100
(Ysam)  Have a nice day.

3860
03:48:40,100 --> 03:48:40,740
(Ysam)  See you, Fiorella.

3861
03:48:40,740 --> 03:48:40,980
(Ysam)  See you.

3862
03:48:40,980 --> 03:48:41,220
(Ysam)  Bye-bye.

3863
03:48:42,420 --> 03:48:43,060
(Ysam)  Thank you.

3864
03:48:43,060 --> 03:48:43,460
(Ysam)  Have a good day.

3865
03:48:43,460 --> 03:48:44,180
(Ysam)  Hasta luego.

3866
03:48:44,900 --> 03:48:45,700
(Ysam)  Hasta luego.

3867
03:48:45,700 --> 03:48:46,660
(Ysam)  Hasta luego.

3868
03:48:46,660 --> 03:48:47,060
(Ysam)  See you.

3869
03:48:47,060 --> 03:48:47,780
(Fiorella)  Bye-bye.

3870
03:48:47,780 --> 03:48:48,340
(Fiorella)  Bye-bye.

3871
03:48:48,340 --> 03:48:50,180
(Fiorella)  Thank you.

3872
03:49:06,340 --> 03:49:18,180
Bye-bye.

3873
03:49:36,340 --> 03:49:38,340
Bye-bye.
